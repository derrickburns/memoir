# Voice Assessment: Original vs. Proposed Chapters

**Date:** 2025-11-14
**Purpose:** Evaluate if proposed chapters maintain Derrick's authentic voice

---

## Your Authentic Voice (From Originals)

### What I Hear in Your Original Chapters:

**1. Direct, Unflinching Honesty**
> "I was tired of her yelling, tired of her telling me to get off the phone, tired of her judging Dave! Enough was enough. I may not be able to shut her up, but I could shut me up." (Ch 7)

> "It was a cold war, and I was determined to win it. I wanted to hurt her the way she hurt Dave with her constant criticism." (Ch 7)

**This is raw. This is a child admitting he wanted to hurt his mother. No softening. No "I didn't understand at the time." Just the truth.**

**2. Specificity Grounded in Black Experience**
> "You will get your education so you don't have to wash white people's clothes or take care of white people's babies." (Ch 3 - Aunt Mae's words)

**This is not universal. This is specifically Black. The directive is clear, unsoftened.**

**3. Psychological Insight Without Over-Explanation**
> "While she never explicitly compared us, we both could hear the unspoken question hanging in the air: 'Why can't you be like Derrick?'" (Ch 7)

**Names the dynamic without over-explaining it. Trusts the reader.**

**4. Child's Voice Mixed with Adult Understanding**
> "Was I betraying Mom and Daddy for wishing I could stay? Was I ungrateful, bad, for wanting this place where mistakes didn't matter?" (Ch 3)

**Child's confusion, stated directly. Adult doesn't swoop in to explain or justify.**

**5. Concrete, Sensory Details That Serve Emotion**
> "When I finally cornered her near the back steps and tried to climb on, Snuffy gave me a look that clearly said 'Not happening, kid' and trotted away with dignified indifference" (Ch 3)

**Playful, specific, serves the feeling of freedom at Aunt Mae's. Not abstract.**

## Problems in Proposed Chapters (My Edits)

### Where I SOFTENED Your Voice:

**Problem 1: I Made It Too Literary**

**Your Original (Ch 3):**
> "No Primary Church this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the right moments. No getting in trouble for whispering to Mary like last week when Mom was our teacher and made me sit in the front row by myself, my face burning while everyone stared."

**My Proposed Chapter 3:**
> "It wasn't the formal, careful belonging of Primary Church at Metropolitan, where Mom watched to make sure I sat still and acted right."

**VERDICT:** ❌ I ABSTRACTED IT
- Lost the specific incident (whispering to Mary)
- Lost "my face burning while everyone stared" (visceral shame)
- Made it "formal, careful belonging" (too literary, too distanced)
- **Your version is RAW. My version is POLISHED.**

---

**Problem 2: I Cut Your Specificity**

**Your Original (Ch 3):**
> "In the car, I watched her house shrink in the rear window. Mom talked about our tasks for the week, but I wasn't listening. I was thinking about how Aunt Mae never scolded me. Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?"

**My Proposed Chapter 3:**
> [Cut this entirely in final edit]

**VERDICT:** ❌ I CUT THE CHILD'S DIRECT QUESTION
- "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?" is DIRECT and RAW
- It's a child's actual thought, unflinching
- I removed it to avoid "over-explanation" but this ISN'T explanation - it's FEELING
- **I was wrong to cut this.**

---

**Problem 3: I Added "Literary" Distance**

**Your Original (Ch 3):**
> "'Aunt Mae?'
> 'Yes, Shug?'
> 'Can I come back next weekend?'
> 'If your mama says it's alright, you're always welcome here.'
> She meant it."

**My Proposed Chapter 3:**
> [Dialogue is similar, but I removed "She meant it"]

**VERDICT:** ⚠️ MINOR BUT MATTERS
- "She meant it" is child's voice - direct assessment
- It's not over-explanation; it's psychological observation
- Your voice includes these direct statements

---

**Problem 4: I Smoothed Contradictions**

**Your Original (Ch 3):**
> "I felt good inside" (about being called Shug)
> "But what if Mom said no? What if she discovered I preferred it here? The guilt crept in—was I betraying Mom and Daddy for wishing I could stay? Was I ungrateful, bad, for wanting this place where mistakes didn't matter?"

**My Proposed Chapter 3:**
> "The confusion lived in loving both, but feeling so different in each space. Was I betraying Mom by preferring Aunt Mae's? Was I ungrateful for wanting this place where mistakes didn't matter? Was there something wrong with me for feeling more at home in a house that wasn't mine than in the one where I slept every night?"

**VERDICT:** ⚠️ MIXED
- I kept the questions (good)
- BUT I softened "bad" to "something wrong with me" (less direct)
- **Your word "bad" is a child's word. More honest.**

---

**Problem 5: I Made the Ice Cream Scene Too Poetic**

**Your Original (Ch 3):**
> "When we finally lifted the lid, revealing perfect, creamy swirls inside, she handed me the first spoon.
>
> The ice cream was cold and sweet and perfect. But more than that, it was something we had created together. This bore no resemblance to the store-bought varieties Mom served at home."

**My Proposed Chapter 3:**
> "The ice cream itself was good—rich vanilla flavored with extract. But that's not what I remember most. What I remember is Aunt Mae's hands covering mine. What I remember is being invited to help, to be close, to contribute something that mattered. What I remember is the feeling that even when I wasn't strong enough alone, she would be there to help me finish what we started together."

**VERDICT:** ❌ I MADE IT TOO ABSTRACT
- Your version: concrete (cold, sweet, perfect, created together, unlike store-bought)
- My version: "What I remember is..." repeated (too literary, too distanced)
- **Your version is grounded. Mine floats into abstraction.**

---

## Where I GOT IT RIGHT:

**Success 1: Kept Your Direct Psychological Naming**

**Chapter 7:**
> "I wanted to hurt her the way she hurt Dave with her constant criticism. I wanted her to feel what it was like to be shut out, controlled, dismissed."

**VERDICT:** ✓ KEPT THIS
- Direct admission of wanting to hurt Mom
- No softening, no justification
- This is your voice

**Success 2: Kept Child's Directness**

**Chapter 4 (Dave Arrives):**
> "'I'm lonely!' The words burst from me like water through a broken dam. 'I want a brother!'"

**VERDICT:** ✓ DIRECT AND RAW
- Child's actual cry
- Not explained, not softened
- This works

**Success 3: Kept Concrete Details**

**Chapter 4:**
> "A peanut butter and jelly sandwich waited on a paper towel, cut diagonally just the way I liked it. Next to it sat a glass of milk, beads of condensation rolling down the sides."

**VERDICT:** ✓ SPECIFIC AND GROUNDED
- Not abstract
- Serves the loneliness through concrete absence
- This is your style

---

## The Core Problem With My Edits

### I Was Trying to Make It "Literary" When You Need It RAW

**What I did:**
- Removed specific incidents in favor of general statements
- Made language more elevated/poetic
- Cut direct child observations ("She meant it," "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?")
- Turned concrete details into abstract reflections

**What I SHOULD have done:**
- Kept every specific incident
- Kept concrete language
- Kept child's direct questions and observations
- Only cut ADULT over-explanation, not CHILD voice

**The Difference:**

**Adult Over-Explanation (CUT THIS):**
> "Years later, I would understand what made those weekends so powerful. Aunt Mae showed me what unconditional love felt like. She showed me that I could be wanted exactly as I was, without achievement or performance or careful behavior."

**Child's Direct Voice (KEEP THIS):**
> "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?"

**I cut BOTH. I should have only cut the first.**

## Specific Examples of White-Gaze Softening

**Problem: I Universal-ized Aunt Mae's Directive**

**Your Original:**
> "'You will get your education so you don't have to wash white people's clothes or take care of white people's babies,' Aunt Mae had told Mom years before, as Mom repeated to me throughout my childhood."

**My Proposed Chapter 3:**
> "How she'd pushed Mom to get her education: 'You will get your education so you don't have to wash white people's clothes or take care of white people's babies.'"

**VERDICT:** ⚠️ I KEPT THE QUOTE BUT SOFTENED CONTEXT
- Your version: "as Mom repeated to me throughout my childhood" (shows this is foundational, repeated, drilled in)
- My version: presented as backstory about Aunt Mae
- **Loses the weight of repetition, the urgency, the way this shaped your childhood**

---

**Problem: I Removed Black Church Specificity**

**Your Original (Ch 3):**
> "No Primary Church this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the right moments. No getting in trouble for whispering to Mary like last week when Mom was our teacher and made me sit in the front row by myself, my face burning while everyone stared."

**My Version:**
> [Generalized to "formal, careful belonging"]

**VERDICT:** ❌ I ERASED THE SPECIFICITY
- Lost the shame of being singled out IN CHURCH
- Lost Mom as Primary Church TEACHER (specific power dynamic)
- Lost "my face burning while everyone stared" (visceral Black child experience of public shame)
- **Made it universal when it's SPECIFIC**

---

## Assessment Against Your Voice Requirements

### 1. Direct and Honest to a Fault?

**Original Chapters:** ✓ YES
- "I wanted to hurt her"
- "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?"
- Direct child thoughts, no filter

**My Proposed Chapters:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY
- Kept some directness
- BUT smoothed too many edges
- Made it more "literary" than raw

---

### 2. Deep Psychological Insight?

**Original Chapters:** ✓ YES
- But insight comes through CHILD observations, not adult analysis
- "She meant it" - child assessing adult sincerity
- "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?" - child comparing love styles

**My Proposed Chapters:** ❌ WRONG APPROACH
- I cut child psychological observations
- I added adult reflective analysis
- **I had it backwards**

---

### 3. Raw and Authentic, Not Polished?

**Original Chapters:** ✓ RAW
- "my face burning while everyone stared"
- "I wanted to hurt her"
- Concrete, jagged, uncomfortable

**My Proposed Chapters:** ❌ TOO POLISHED
- "formal, careful belonging" (abstracted)
- "What I remember is..." (distanced)
- Smoothed the jagged edges

---

### 4. Black Experience, Not White Gaze?

**Original Chapters:** ✓ UNAPOLOGETICALLY BLACK
- Aunt Mae's directive about not washing white people's clothes
- Primary Church with Mom as teacher, public shaming
- Specific Black Detroit churches (Metropolitan vs. Corinthian)

**My Proposed Chapters:** ⚠️ SOFTENED
- Kept some specificity
- BUT abstracted/generalized key moments
- Lost some of the weight and urgency

---

### 5. Truth That Smacks the Reader?

**Original Chapters:** ✓ SMACKS
- "I wanted to hurt her"
- Child openly preferring Aunt Mae to Mom
- No justification, no softening

**My Proposed Chapters:** ⚠️ CUSHIONED SOME BLOWS
- Kept major moments
- BUT made language more "literary" which creates distance
- Distance = less impact

---

## Brutal Honest Truth

### What I Got Wrong:

**1. I confused "over-explanation" with "child's voice"**
   - Adult analysis = cut
   - Child's direct observations = KEEP
   - I cut both

**2. I prioritized "literary" over "raw"**
   - Made language more elevated
   - Created distance through abstraction
   - Lost some visceral impact

**3. I generalized when you need specificity**
   - "Formal, careful belonging" instead of "face burning while everyone stared"
   - Lost concrete incidents
   - Made it more universal, less specifically Black

**4. I smoothed edges**
   - Changed "bad" to "something wrong with me"
   - Cut "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?"
   - Made contradictions less sharp

---

## What Needs to Change in Proposed Chapters

### Chapter 3: Refuge

**RESTORE:**
1. Primary Church incident with Mary - full detail, face burning, Mom making you sit in front
2. "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?" - child's direct question
3. More concrete ice cream description (your version), less abstract "what I remember"
4. "She meant it" - child's assessment
5. Consider restoring some specificity about Aunt Mae's directive being repeated throughout childhood

**CUT:**
- "Formal, careful belonging" abstraction
- "What I remember is..." repetitive structure (too literary)
- Some of my elevated language

---

### Chapter 4: Dave Arrives

**MOSTLY GOOD, BUT CHECK:**
- Does it maintain child's directness throughout?
- Any places where I made it too poetic?
- Is the loneliness visceral or abstracted?

**SEEMS OKAY because:**
- "I'm lonely! I want a brother!" is direct
- Sensory details are concrete
- Less of my "literary" intervention

---

### Chapter 5: Shared Refuge

**PROBABLY OKAY because:**
- Dad's bowling scene is concrete and direct
- Boys Town is visceral
- Less philosophical reflection (good)

**BUT CHECK:**
- Did I lose any specific incidents?
- Is the contrast between Aunt Mae and Mom sharp enough?

---

## Core Principle I Violated

**Your voice is:**
- Child's direct observations + Adult's psychological insight
- Concrete details + Sharp emotional truth
- Specific Black experience + Universal human longing
- Raw honesty + Elevated but not abstract language

**What I did:**
- Cut child's observations to avoid "over-explanation"
- Made details more abstract/poetic
- Softened some Black specificity
- Polished when it should stay jagged

**What I should do:**
- Keep child's voice intact (direct questions, observations, feelings)
- ONLY cut adult reflective analysis that explains what scenes show
- Keep all concrete details
- Keep all sharp edges
- Make language precise, not pretty

---

## Recommendation

**Go back to Chapter 3 (Refuge) and:**

1. Restore Primary Church incident - FULL detail
2. Restore "Why couldn't Mom be more like Aunt Mae?"
3. Restore more concrete ice cream language from your original
4. Cut my "what I remember" repetitive structure
5. Restore "She meant it"
6. Consider how much weight to give Aunt Mae's repeated directive

**Principle:**
- Child's direct voice = KEEP (even if it seems like over-explanation)
- Adult reflective analysis = CUT (if it explains what scenes show)
- Concrete specifics = KEEP
- Abstract generalizations = CUT
- Raw edges = KEEP
- Polished smoothing = CUT

---

## The Real Issue

**I edited to make it "better writing" by literary standards.**
**You need it to be "honest writing" by truth-telling standards.**

**Literary = elevated, careful, crafted**
**Honest = direct, raw, unflinching**

**You can be BOTH, but when they conflict, HONEST wins.**

**I chose literary. I was wrong.**

---

**Status:** Voice assessment complete
**Verdict:** Proposed chapters need MORE rawness, LESS polish
**Action:** Restore child's direct voice, keep concrete specifics, sharpen edges
