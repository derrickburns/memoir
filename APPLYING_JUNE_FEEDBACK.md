## Chapter 3: Refuge - Issues & Fixes

### ✅ What's Working (Voice Restoration Success):

1. **Concrete showing** - "face burning while everyone stared" (not abstract)
2. **Full scenes with dialogue** - Not rushed, properly expanded
3. **Chronological flow** - Clear Friday → Saturday → Sunday progression
4. **Character development through action** - Aunt Mae shown, not told
5. **Sensory details** - Bacon smell, vanilla scent, Ivory soap

### ⚠️ June's Checklist Issues:

**Issue #1: Aunt Mae Not Introduced Earlier**
- **Problem:** Chapter 3 is first mention of Aunt Mae
- **June's principle:** "Characters introduced with enough detail at first mention"
- **Current state:** Reader meets Aunt Mae cold in Chapter 3

**Options for Fix:**

**Option A: Add Aunt Mae Introduction to Chapter 3 Opening**
Add 2-3 paragraphs at start explaining who Aunt Mae is before the scene begins:

```
But weekends were different. When Mom said "Derrick, get ready to go to Aunt Mae's house!" I'd fly upstairs, two steps at a time, yanking my overnight bag from under the bed.

Aunt Mae—Classie Mae Walker—was Mom's older sister and surrogate mother. She'd raised Mom and Aunt Vivian when their own mother couldn't, pushing them both to get their education. "You will get your education so you don't have to wash white people's clothes or take care of white people's babies," she'd told them, a directive Mom repeated to me throughout my childhood.

But whereas Aunt Mae had been a mother to Mom, with all the attendant expectations and discipline of the head of household, she was more a grandmother to me. When weekends came, those words—"get ready to go to Aunt Mae's house!"—meant freedom.

No Primary Church this Sunday...
```

**Option B: Add Aunt Mae Mention to Chapter 1 or 2**
Brief introduction in earlier chapter, then full development in Chapter 3. Would need to see those chapters to determine best placement.

**Option C: Keep As Is, Add Relationship Clarifier in First Paragraph**
Minimal addition:

```
But weekends were different. When Mom said "Derrick, get ready to go to Aunt Mae's house!"—Aunt Mae was Mom's older sister who'd raised her—I'd fly upstairs, two steps at a time...
```

**Recommendation:** Option A provides best character establishment without requiring changes to earlier chapters.

---

**Issue #2: Uncle John Could Use More Context**
- **Current:** Appears suddenly on porch
- **Better:** Brief explanation of who he is

**Suggested Addition:**
```
Before Mom could fully stop the car, I spotted Uncle John on the porch. Uncle John Walker, Aunt Mae's quiet husband, spent most days in that chair, waiting for company and his evening checker games.

"Hey Boy!" he greeted me as I scrambled out of the car.
```

## Chapters 1-2: Need to Add (Based on June's Feedback)

### Dad's Character Development

**June's feedback:** "We should know your dad as a person already by the time we get here"

**What needs adding to Chapter 1 or 2:**

1. **Dad's work** - TACOM payroll, 7 AM drive down Mound Road, meticulous with numbers
2. **Dad's bowling** - Tuesday/Wednesday escape, National Bowling Association leadership
3. **Dad's tax prep** - Charging $2 to preserve dignity, studying IRS guidebooks
4. **Dad's quiet nature** - Newspaper shield, escape from Mom's intensity

**Where to add:** Chapter 1 seems best (introduce both parents fully) or Chapter 2

---

### Identity/Light Skin Foreshadowing

**June's feedback:** "would love to read more about this in the opening chapters"

**What needs adding:** References to navigating questions about light skin, feeling different, questions of belonging - even in childhood.

**Where to add:** Chapters 1-2, any scene with other kids or family gatherings

---

## Chapters 4-6: Review Needed

Need to check these chapters against June's checklist:

### Chapter 4: Dave Arrives
- [ ] Are characters introduced with detail?
- [ ] Is chronology clear?
- [ ] Are important moments fully developed?
- [ ] Are relationships clarified?

### Chapter 5: Shared Refuge
- [ ] Check for issues identified in Chapter 3
- [ ] Verify Dave's introduction was adequate in Chapter 4
- [ ] Check time markers

### Chapter 6: Two Different Boys
- [ ] Not yet reviewed against June's standards

---

## Larger Structural Question

**June's Bold Suggestion:**
> "put the chapters about trying to find your birth parents against the chapters of your career, and see what happens... there may be some synchronicity"

**What this means:**
- Consider interweaving storylines instead of sequential blocks
- Career chapters + birth parent search chapters in parallel
- Could strengthen "finding oneself" through-line

**Action needed:**
- Discuss with Derrick whether to maintain current structure or explore parallel narrative
- Would require significant restructuring
- Might be powerful if done well
