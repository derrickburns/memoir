Chapter 17: The Decline

**Christmas Morning 1995**

6:17 AM. The digital clock glowed red in the darkness.

Maya's stage whisper carried from the hallway: "Mama, is Santa here?"

I pulled the comforter over my head, creating a cave of darkness. The weight pressed against my chest—not just fabric, but the accumulation of a thousand small failures.

Gina's voice, carefully neutral: "Let's let Daddy sleep a little longer."

"But Daddddd?! Santa came!"

They were waiting for me. Not Santa. Me.

I couldn't move.

What terrified me most wasn't failing at the performance. It was the possibility that there was nothing authentic beneath it. That maybe I really was a failure, and all the achievements—SGI, the streaming video, the promotions—were just elaborate masks hiding emptiness.

The kids' excited voices faded down the hallway. Gina would handle it. She always handled it.

I stayed under the covers.

Eventually, I forced myself up. When I finally emerged into the living room, Gina formed a smile on her face, but her eyes betrayed her real pain.

"Let's open presents!" she said, her voice bright for the kids.

"Here is one for Jamil!" Maya announced, grabbing one of the dozens of individually wrapped presents that Gina and I had wrapped the night before. The packages spilled out from under the Christmas tree, filling our small living room.

Gina's eyes met mine for just a moment. Then she turned to help Jamil with the wrapping paper, the smile still fixed on her face.

**Early 1995 - The Peak**

SGI's market cap peaked just above $7 billion in 1995.

My own tenure crested around the same time, when I was promoted to second-level leadership. From there, the decline began—more political, more personal, and far less about technical merit than I had imagined.

At SGI, we built Ferraris: beautiful, powerful, expensive machines that pushed the boundaries of what was possible. The world wanted reliable Toyotas.

The mismatch was becoming impossible to ignore.

**1995 - Ken Coleman's Investment**

Ken Coleman saw something in me I couldn't see in myself.

He gave me a GM role with P&L responsibility, paired me with Malcolm Jones to teach me the business side of technology. Then he sponsored me for the Harvard Course on Negotiation, where Professor Margaret Neale taught BATNA—Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. The concept was simple but powerful: know your walkaway point before you enter any negotiation.

He also secured me a spot in the Stanford GSB/American Electronics Association Executive Institute.

"You have the technical skills," Ken said. "Now you need the leadership tools."

I was stunned by this level of investment. Grateful.

Ken Coleman was one of the few Black executives at SGI's level. Willie C. Hooks, brought in from DEC, was another. Ken recruited three of us—all Black men at director level—to become general managers in his professional services business.

Blake was the third. Ten years older than me, smooth as a used car salesman, with a smile that would melt butter and deep knowledge and connections in Hollywood. He understood the gravity of the opportunity Ken was offering us.

But Blake wasn't an engineer. And I wanted to feel like a peer, if not superior. So I lashed out, criticizing him behind his back.

Ken found out.

But Ken saw more than my potential. He also saw my anger.

**1995 - The Confrontation**

We were waiting for the elevator when Ken turned to me.

"Your anger," he said, voice low. "Your mistrust of colleagues. Blake is your ally, not your enemy."

I started to protest, but Ken pressed his finger into my chest.

"You don't lash out just because you feel anger. Know yourself. Control yourself."

The elevator arrived. We stepped in. Silence.

Later, in his office, Ken asked a different question: "What are you really angry about?"

"I don't know how to do this," I admitted.

"Do what?"

"Leadership. Politics. The things that everyone else seems to understand naturally."

Ken nodded slowly. "So when someone else has skills you lack, you lash out. Jealousy disguised as mistrust."

The recognition hit hard. He was right.

I'd spent my life compensating for what I didn't know by mastering what I could control: code, mathematics, technical systems. But leadership required navigating ambiguity, reading people, managing emotions—mine and others'.

And when I couldn't master it instantly, I got angry.

**Late 1995 - The Search Reignites**

By late 1995, the landscape had shifted.

Maya started kindergarten, her backpack almost too big for her small frame. Three-year-old Jamil constructed elaborate block cities in the living room, knocking them down and rebuilding with endless patience.

Their growing independence created space. And into that space, the search returned.

During visits to Detroit, Dad would ask: "Any news about your search?"

His question came with genuine curiosity, never judgment. He never made me feel that searching for my birth father reflected poorly on him as my dad. His questions weren't tinged with insecurity but with the same engaged intelligence he brought to everything.

Mom's approach was different. Her brave suggestion that I search had always felt more like parental duty than personal desire. I sensed her discomfort, so I protected her emotions just as she had always protected mine.

By September 1995, I renewed the search with fresh determination.

Over the next year, a frustrating dance with bureaucracy ensued. Letters to the Probate Court. Meetings with officials. Polite responses that my "social file" was lost.

After exhausting standard avenues, I decided to pivot.

The search was back. And with it, the familiar pattern: when things felt uncertain at home or work, I retreated into the methodical hunt for answers about my past.

**End of 1995**

Three threads converged by year's end.

At SGI, the market cap had peaked, and the slow decline was beginning. We'd built technology the world wasn't ready for, and the financial markets were starting to notice.

At home, I was managing two young children while Gina navigated the pressures of being a Black female physician. She was working to form Kaiser's first Spanish Module—a bilingual primary care team that would officially open in 1997 with her as Module Chief and Founder. While I was declining, she was building something that mattered.

The Christmas morning when I couldn't get out of bed had revealed something I didn't want to acknowledge: depression, failure, the weight of performing excellence while feeling hollow inside.

And in probate offices and legal directories, I was searching for a man who might not want to be found, using clues too vague to narrow the field.

The irony was clear: I could build streaming video systems a decade ahead of their time, but I couldn't find peace in my own present. I could lead teams and close deals, but I couldn't lead myself out from under the covers on Christmas morning.

Success in one domain had never protected me from failure in another.

And all the professional development in the world—Harvard negotiation courses, Stanford executive programs—couldn't answer the question that plagued me since childhood:

Who am I, really, beneath all the performance?
