Chapter 5: Shared Refuge

**Two Shugs**

Weekend visits to Aunt Mae's took on new meaning with Dave beside me. What had been my private sanctuary became our shared refuge - a place where both of us could simply be, without the weight of Mom's expectations or the pressure to perform.

Aunt Mae welcomed Dave with the same immediate, unconditional acceptance she'd always shown me. Watching her with Dave revealed something important: this wasn't about me being special. This was about her way of loving - complete, uncomplicated, unconditional. She didn't love me because I earned good grades or acted right or made her proud. She loved me because I existed. Because I walked through her door. Because I was exactly who she'd been hoping to see, every single time.

Dave and I were different children. I was careful, controlled, driven by The Project to achieve and excel. Dave was easier, more natural with people, quicker to laugh and slower to worry about what adults thought. When we helped Aunt Mae with tasks, I'd concentrate intensely on doing everything perfectly. Dave would chat and joke, making her laugh, not worrying if he spilled or made mistakes.

Aunt Mae loved us both exactly the same.

Friday nights, we'd make the bed together in the small back bedroom - Dave and me giggling while Aunt Mae directed our efforts with gentle patience. She'd wash both our faces, lifting us each onto the wooden stool in turn. Then we'd squeeze into the curve of the couch together, nestled under her arms while she read her Bible in the lamplight.

Saturday mornings, Dave would wake to the smell of bacon with the same wonder I still felt. We'd both help with breakfast - breaking eggs (more shells), setting the table (mismatched placement), pouring juice (spilling some). None of it mattered. Aunt Mae would just smile and guide our hands.

We'd play with Snuffy in the backyard, Dave delighted by the golden collie's patient tolerance. I showed him the secret to avoiding her deposits, the best spots to scratch behind her ears, the way to lie in the grass next to her with your hand buried in soft fur.

Uncle John would greet us both from his porch chair: "Hey Boys!" His warm voice making us both wave before returning to whatever Aunt Mae had invited us to do next.

Sunday at Corinthian Baptist Church, Aunt Mae's voice would rise in the choir loft while Dave and I sat together in the pew. After service, she'd buy us both Fanta orange pops, and we'd stand in the fellowship hall while the congregation claimed us: "Are those Classie's nephews?" "Yes ma'am." "Well, aren't they handsome!"

At Aunt Mae's, there was no comparison. No "Why can't you be like Derrick?" No measuring Dave's ease against my achievement or my awkwardness against his natural friendliness. We were just two boys she loved, completely and equally, for no reason except that we were hers.

**Dad's Escape**

At home, the differences between Dave and me created friction in ways that made the house feel smaller. Where I flourished under Mom's pressure, Dave wilted. Where I craved approval through achievement, Dave sought acceptance through connection.

Every Tuesday and Wednesday evening, Dad went bowling. It was his escape, his space apart from Mom's intensity. But one Wednesday night, Mom's frustration boiled over.

"Boys, get in the car."

"Where are we going?" I asked.

"To get your father."

The bowling alley hit us with a wall of sound and smoke. Pins crashing, men laughing, cigarettes burning in ashtrays. I'd never seen Dad like this—relaxed, laughing with his bowling buddies, his whole body language different from the quiet, careful man who read the newspaper in his chair at home.

Mom grabbed Dad's elbow. "Howard, we need to go."

He turned, surprised. "Willa, what are you doing here?"

"It's a school night. The boys have homework."

I could feel eyes on us—Dad's friends watching, curious or uncomfortable. Dave pressed close to my side.

The ride home was silent, tension thick in the air. But when we pulled into the driveway, Dad's voice cut through the quiet with an authority I'd never heard him use with Mom.

"Willa, if you don't want the boys around smoking, drinking, and cursing, don't bring them to the bowling alley."

Mom said nothing. But something had shifted. I'd glimpsed how different my parents could be, how Dad carved out spaces where Mom's control couldn't quite reach, and how fragile those spaces were.

We all needed refuge somewhere. Dad had his bowling league. Dave and I had Aunt Mae's. Even Mom had her classroom, where her intensity was channeled into helping other people's children succeed.

That's what made it confusing. At home, my careful performance earned approval while Dave's ease often earned correction: "Why can't you be like Derrick?" But at Aunt Mae's, there was no performance requirement. No comparison. No need to be anything other than ourselves.

**Boys Town**

One summer, we took a family road trip toward Los Angeles. Dad had the AAA Triptik mapped out, the TourBook marking potential stops. Dave and I fought over who got the window seat until Mom made us switch every hour.

Mom had planned a detour: Boys Town in Nebraska.

We pulled into the parking lot, and there it was—the bronze statue that appeared on every piece of Boys Town literature. A bigger boy carrying a smaller one on his back, the inscription reading: "He ain't heavy, Mister... he's m' brother!"

Families gathered around, taking photos. A little kid asked his mother, "Why's that boy carrying the other one?"

"Because that's what brothers do," she said. "They help each other."

Dave's face went expressionless—almost like he was asleep except his eyes were wide open. I felt my pulse racing, pressure building in my chest, a lump forming in my throat I couldn't swallow.

Mom's hand rested on Dave's shoulder as the tour guide talked about Father Flanagan, about how Boys Town started as a place for boys who had nowhere else to go. Boys who needed homes.

Boys like Dave?

I couldn't meet Dave's eyes. Questions I couldn't ask hung in the air between us: Did Dave think this was why we stopped here? Was Mom reconsidering? Was she showing us what could still happen if we didn't behave?

The drive away from Boys Town was subdued. The radio seemed muted. Endless cornfields rolled past the windows. Then I felt Dave's hand find mine between us on the back seat—a simple gesture that carried everything we couldn't say aloud.

We never made it to Los Angeles that trip. Dad was too tired, and he wouldn't let Mom drive. Denver became our destination. LA remained a dream for another time. But what I remember most is Dave's hand in mine, and the question neither of us dared to ask: How permanent was our place in this family?

**The Contrast**

Sunday afternoons still meant leaving Aunt Mae's.

She would pack leftover ice cream and hand it to Mom at the door. She'd hug us both: "You boys be good for your mama now."

Dave and I would climb into the back seat of Mom's Pontiac. As we drove back home, Mom would remind us of chores we had not done.

"Derrick, when you get home, I want you to wash the dishes. Dave, you dry and sweep the floor. Derrick, you need to clean the bathroom. Don't make me have to tell you again. I want this done right tonight."

Through the window, we'd watch the houses on each side of the block pass by. Some neighbors sat on their porches like Uncle John. We'd quickly get to 7 Mile Road where I'd see the A&P grocery store and the diagonal intersection of Conant and 7 Mile Road. We'd pass Pershing High School and the Dairy Queen. On occasion, Mom would stop there.

The happy carefree weekend with Aunt Mae ended in a list of tasks to be done. Mom had no time to play.
