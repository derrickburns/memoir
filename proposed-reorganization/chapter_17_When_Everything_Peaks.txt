Chapter 17: When Everything Peaks (1995)

**Early 1995 - The Summit**

SGI's market cap peaked just above $7 billion in early 1995.

My own tenure crested around the same time, when I was promoted to second-level leadership. General Manager with P&L responsibility. Harvard negotiation training. Stanford executive institute. Ken Coleman's investment paying off with tangible recognition.

From the outside, everything looked like success.

Inside, I was drowning.

**Spring 1995 - The Performance**

At SGI, I'd built Ferraris—beautiful, powerful, expensive machines that pushed the boundaries of what was possible. Streaming video with VCR controls. Technology a decade ahead. Technical achievements that should have felt triumphant.

Instead, I felt hollow.

The world wanted reliable Toyotas. Our customers were locked into SGI hardware, stuck until their systems fully depreciated. But the writing was on the wall: cheaper products were coming. Competition from below, as it almost always does in technology.

And I was supposed to figure out how to turn our Ferrari-building expertise into repeatable professional services offerings that customers would pay for predictably.

Malcolm was patient. Willie was supportive. Ken was investing in my development.

But I had no idea what I was doing.

Every meeting felt like performance. Smile. Nod. Take notes. Pretend I understood customer needs I'd never taken time to learn. Pretend I could package solutions when I'd spent my entire career building custom systems.

Blake knew how to do this. Malcolm knew. Willie knew.

I was faking it, and the fear of being exposed gnawed at me constantly.

**Summer 1995 - What Gina Was Building**

While I was struggling, Gina was thriving.

Her vision for Kaiser's Spanish Module was taking shape. She'd identified the problem: Spanish-speaking patients poorly served, relying on translators who couldn't capture medical nuance. She'd proposed the solution: a dedicated team of bilingual physicians serving this population directly.

By summer 1995, she had buy-in. The Module would officially open in 1997 with her as Module Chief and Founder, but the groundwork was happening now.

She was solving real problems for real people. Building something that mattered.

I watched her come home exhausted from Kaiser, manage Maya and Jamil with patience I didn't have, and still find energy to work on her Module plans late into the night.

She was building bridges. I was building walls.

**Fall 1995 - The Search Renews**

By September 1995, Maya had started kindergarten, her backpack almost too big for her small frame. Five years old, walking into school with the same intensity she'd shown since birth.

Jamil, three years old, constructed elaborate block cities in the living room, knocking them down and rebuilding with endless patience.

Their growing independence created space.

And into that space, the search returned.

I couldn't let it go. Three years of dead ends—seven names that led nowhere, law libraries that yielded nothing, Mr. Littlejohn's apology that he had no records.

But I wasn't done.

In November 1996, I reached out to Mr. Littlejohn again, this time with renewed determination. I explained everything I knew in greater detail. The probate court description. The timeline. The Ivy League background. The law degree from "another prestigious university."

"Let me see what I can find," he said.

I hung up feeling hope for the first time in years.

**Visits to Detroit - Dad's Questions**

During visits to Detroit that fall, Dad would ask: "Any news about your search?"

His question came with genuine curiosity, never judgment. He never made me feel that searching for my birth father reflected poorly on him as my dad. His questions weren't tinged with insecurity but with the same engaged intelligence he brought to everything.

In the living room where I'd grown up, I'd sometimes catch him watching me with an expression I couldn't quite define—not concern, exactly, but quiet assessment. In those moments, I realized Dad was witnessing my search not as rejection of my upbringing, but as extension of the independent thinking he and Mom had always encouraged.

Mom's approach was different. Her brave suggestion years ago that I search had always felt more like parental duty than personal desire. I sensed her discomfort, so I protected her emotions just as she had always protected mine.

Their unspoken support allowed me freedom to search without the burden of their feelings—a final parenting gift I only recognized years later.

**The Weight**

By late 1995, three threads were pulling me in different directions:

**At work:** SGI's market cap had peaked. The slow decline was beginning. I'd been promoted to second-level leadership but was drowning in a role I didn't understand. Netscape had gone public in August, and every day I was reminded of the door I'd been too afraid to walk through.

**At home:** Gina was building her Spanish Module while managing two young children and a husband who was physically present but emotionally absent. She carried everything. I admired her strength but didn't know how to truly support her.

**The search:** Dead ends for years, but hope rekindling. Mr. Littlejohn might have a new lead. Maybe this time would be different.

Each thread demanded everything. Each one was failing in its own way.

And underneath it all, a question I couldn't escape: Who am I beneath all these performances?

**December 24, 1995 - Christmas Eve**

Gina and I stayed up late wrapping presents after the kids were asleep.

Dozens of individually wrapped packages. We'd bought too much, trying to create magic, trying to compensate for something neither of us could name.

Maya's gifts. Jamil's gifts. Carefully tagged, arranged under the tree.

Gina worked methodically, tape and scissors moving with practiced efficiency. I fumbled with the wrapping paper, frustrated by corners that wouldn't fold right.

"You're doing fine," she said quietly.

But we both knew I wasn't.

When we finally finished, close to 2 AM, the living room was filled with presents spilling out from under the Christmas tree.

"They're going to love it," Gina said, surveying our work.

"Yeah," I said.

But I felt nothing. Just exhaustion and dread.

Gina went to bed. I sat alone in the living room, staring at the tree, the presents, the performance of Christmas we'd created.

On the wall hung Maya's handprint, painted in SGI's blue and green. A "World's Best Dad" plaque that felt more like accusation than celebration.

At work, I wrote clean code that made machines sing. At home, I struggled to decode my own children's needs.

I went to bed around 3 AM, knowing I had to be up in a few hours.

Knowing I wouldn't be able to do it.

**Christmas Morning 1995 - 6:17 AM**

The digital clock glowed red in the darkness.

Maya's stage whisper carried from the hallway: "Mama, is Santa here?"

I heard Gina's voice, carefully neutral: "Let's let Daddy sleep a little longer."

I pulled the comforter over my head, creating a cave of darkness. The weight pressed against my chest—not just fabric, but the accumulation of a thousand small failures.

"But Daddddd?! Santa came!"

They were waiting for me. Not Santa. Me.

What terrified me most wasn't failing at the performance. It was the possibility that there was nothing authentic beneath it. That maybe I really was a failure, and all the achievements—SGI, the streaming video, the promotions, the Harvard courses, the Stanford programs—were just elaborate masks hiding emptiness.

The kids' excited voices faded down the hallway. Gina would handle it. She always handled it.

I stayed under the covers.

I don't know how long I lay there. Twenty minutes? An hour? Time dissolved in the darkness under the comforter.

Finally, Maya's voice again, plaintive: "Where's Daddy?"

That broke through.

I forced myself up. Mechanical movements. Feet on floor. Stand. Walk.

When I emerged into the living room, Gina formed a smile on her face, but her eyes betrayed her real pain.

"Let's open presents!" she said, her voice bright for the kids.

"Here is one for Jamil!" Maya announced, grabbing one of the dozens of packages we'd wrapped hours ago.

Jamil tore into the wrapping paper, his smile genuine, unaware.

Maya looked up at me. "Dad, you okay?"

"Yeah, sweetie. Just tired."

Gina's eyes met mine for just a moment. Then she turned to help Jamil with the next present, the performance smile still fixed on her face.

I sat on the couch, watching my family open presents. Watching Gina manage everything—the kids' excitement, the wrapping paper chaos, the performance of Christmas morning—while I sat there, hollow.

Maya's handprint on the wall. "World's Best Dad."

The irony wasn't lost on me.

**January 4, 1997 - The Call**

A month after Christmas, the phone rang.

Ms. Evanski from the Probate Court. "Mr. Burns, I have news. We found a copy of your social file. It was recorded at the Family Independence Agency."

My heart stopped.

"I can request a copy and forward it to you," she said.

"Yes. Please. As soon as possible."

After years of dead ends, suddenly, movement.

I hung up and sat at my desk, staring at the phone.

Maybe this time would be different.

**January 23, 1997 - The Envelope**

The envelope arrived thin, official, unassuming.

I held it for several minutes before opening it, running my fingers along the sealed edge. This ordinary paper might contain the key to everything.

Finally, with an unsteady breath, I tore it open and unfolded the pages.

A copy of the long-missing social file. Names were redacted, but the names of schools were included:

*...had graduated from Harvard College in 1960 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1963.*

A jolt of recognition ran through me.

Not "another Ivy League school." University of Michigan. In-state, not out-of-state like the undergraduate degree.

The clue I'd missed for seven years was suddenly clear.

I immediately called Mr. Littlejohn to share the new findings.

"Harvard College 1960, University of Michigan Law School 1963," I said. "Can you check your records again?"

"Give me a month," he said.

A month felt like forever. But after seven years, what was one more month?

**End of 1995 / Early 1997 - The Convergence**

By early 1997, all three lines of my life were converging toward crisis:

**Professional:** SGI had peaked and was beginning its decline. I'd been promoted to a role I didn't understand, struggling with P&L responsibility, customer relationships, repeatable offerings. Netscape's success was a daily reminder of the road I hadn't taken. Every stock price update felt personal.

**Family:** Christmas morning had revealed something I couldn't ignore anymore. I couldn't get out of bed to be present with my children. Gina was carrying everything—her career, our kids, our household, and the emotional weight of my absence. She was building her Spanish Module, creating something that mattered, while I was drowning in performances that felt increasingly hollow.

**Search:** Seven years of dead ends were about to break open. The social file revealed Harvard and University of Michigan Law. Mr. Littlejohn was searching again. Hope was rekindling after years of failure.

But hope and crisis feel remarkably similar when you're in the middle of them.

I was standing at the peak of my professional life—second-level leadership, executive training, recognition—and I'd never felt more like a fraud.

I was living with a woman building bridges while I built walls, managing our children with a patience I couldn't access, thriving in ways I couldn't see.

I was about to find my birth father's name after seven years of searching, not knowing that discovery would lead only to another kind of absence.

The Christmas morning when I couldn't get out of bed wasn't an aberration. It was the truth breaking through the performance.

I'd spent my life becoming excellent at everything that didn't require emotional presence. Code. Algorithms. Technical leadership. Search methodologies.

But I couldn't be present for my children on Christmas morning. Couldn't support my wife in ways that mattered. Couldn't answer the question beneath all the others:

Who am I when I'm not performing?

The peak wasn't success. It was the moment before everything started falling apart.

And I could feel it coming.

February would bring my birth father's name.

April would bring a sabbatical born of necessity and escape.

But first, I had to live through the performance of being fine when everything was breaking.

Gina knew. She could see it in my eyes every time I came home.

Maya and Jamil were too young to name it, but they felt it. Dad was there, but not really there.

And I knew it too, even if I couldn't say it aloud.

The peak is the loneliest place to realize you're falling.
