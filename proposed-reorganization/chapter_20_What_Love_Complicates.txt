Chapter 19: What Love Complicates

First Meeting - Late June 1997

Approaching Marcia's Woodward Avenue apartment in Birmingham, Michigan, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation. It was June 1997, and my life was in flux. I had just started a sabbatical from Silicon Graphics, ostensibly to interview with Virage and work on my dissertation. But the real reason was standing behind the door I was about to knock on.

Though Marcia knew I existed, I still expected her to be in shock. Our reunion was decades in the making, seven years of my searching, 33 years of her fearing discovery.

I rang the bell, my heart pounding. Moments later, the door swung open, and there she was, Marcia, the woman whose face I had studied in the Mumford High School yearbook, the same striking figure from the photos she'd sent me. Those images captured her in happier times, moments filled with joy, fun, and the kind of normalcy that seemed distant now. But this moment was anything but normal. Awkwardness lingered in the air, a tension shaped by decades of separation and unspoken questions.

"Hello, I'm Derrick," I offered, trying to steady my voice.

She stood silently in the entryway of her apartment, unable to speak. With a nod, she stepped aside. Inside, everything was white, the couches draped with oversized fluffy pillows, brass and glass end tables holding large lamps. Artwork lined the walls, but what caught my eye was a single photo: her daughter, my half-sister, Cara.

When she finally spoke a minute or two later, her words came slowly, as if her mouth was full of cotton.

"Let me get some water. Would you like a glass?" Her voice was soft, tentative.

"Yes, please," I said, remembering the manners Mom had taught me.

As she moved toward the kitchen, I took in her apartment. The decor reflected a refined aesthetic, abstract paintings, art books on the coffee table, soft white modern furniture. It signaled a world I understood: educated, cultured, intellectual. It was no different from the world Mom had crafted for me, no different from the one I had entered at Princeton. But in Detroit, I had never occupied these spaces when they were inhabited by white or Jewish families, familiar cultural worlds I had long observed, but never entered.

She returned with water and showed me old photos of herself, confirming what the social worker had described: stunningly beautiful, with long auburn hair and hazel eyes. In those photos, I saw the features I had inherited, the shape of her eyes, the high cheekbones, the curve of her smile.

She explained that she had lived in the apartment for a few years after returning from Connecticut following her divorce from her third husband, Lawrence. She initially went back to their home in Michigan, but on a school psychologist's income, she couldn't afford the mortgage or upkeep. I learned she taught English literature at a private school, a career she had pursued after her second divorce.

She spoke with measured calm, not guarded, but deliberate, like someone medicated just enough to stay afloat. Anxiety seemed to shadow her.

She pointed to a picture of her daughter with Lawrence, Cara, who was ten years younger than me.

"That's one of the few pictures I have of Cara wearing makeup," she said, her tone carrying judgment.

"She is lovely," I said, looking at the photo for traces of myself.

I wondered what Cara knew of me, if she might someday want to know her half-brother.

As I absorbed the moment, I was struck by how utterly strange it all felt. It reminded me of stepping out of the car when I arrived at Princeton, not knowing which direction to walk in, but knowing I was where I was meant to be. Though I spoke, I kept my feelings to myself. I felt oddly hollow, present, but not fully there.

Our first meeting lasted about three hours. As I left, she hugged me, brief, tentative, and heavy with decades of silence. We agreed to stay in touch, though neither of us seemed ready to define what that would mean.

I flew back to California carrying a strange mixture of fulfillment and emptiness. I had found her. But what had I actually found?

The Honeymoon Phase - Late 1997

Over the next few months, our relationship blossomed with an intensity that surprised us both. We were hungry for knowledge of each other, eager to compress decades of absence into days and weeks of connection.

Marcia wanted to know everything about my childhood, about Gina, about my life in Detroit and at Princeton. I'd share stories for what felt like hours, and she would listen with rapt attention, perhaps trying to piece together the chapters of my life she had missed.

Soon, we were talking for hours each day. I would call her during my commute to and from Silicon Graphics. She was in Michigan, three time zones ahead, so I would catch her mid-morning on my drive in. Each day we would pick a subject: growing up on the East Side of Detroit, her high school years at Mumford, my time at Princeton, my career, and eventually, my marriage.

These conversations became a central part of my routine, a new relationship that consumed much of my emotional energy. The questions became more personal, her feedback more direct. I welcomed her curiosity, her fresh perspective.

I also found myself grappling with the new dimensions of my identity. Learning about my Jewish heritage opened up questions I had never considered. What did it mean to be both Black and Jewish? What does it mean to be Jewish?

I purchased books on Jewish history and identity, titles on being Jewish, on Jewish renewal, on Jewish experience in America. I would delight in the purchase, read the first few pages, mentally catalog its value, and move on to the next shiny thing. My interest in Judaism was like my interest in climate change or the history of Cuba. I wanted the knowledge, but had no real use for it in my life. If it did not change my decisions, my actions, what good was the knowledge? Marcia's Judaism was familial and cultural, not religious or historical. These books offered no help with the real challenge that I faced: connecting with Marcia.

I did not integrate Judaism into my cultural practice during these years with Marcia, but I relished each new Yiddish word that she shared with me. I was a mensch one day and meshuggeneh the next. These linguistic gifts became small cultural touchpoints between us, fragments of her heritage that she passed on to me, even as we struggled to build a stable relationship.

During this time, I found myself navigating multiple identities and loyalties. I called Mom every Sunday as I always had, but now I spoke to Marcia almost daily. I didn't tell Mom about the frequency of my calls with Marcia, feeling somehow that it might hurt her. This created a strange compartmentalization in my life, one that I wasn't entirely comfortable with but didn't know how to resolve.

When Marcia called, I would go to another room, seeking privacy and intimacy. I felt like I was cheating, but how can one cheat with one's own mother? The intensity of our connection defied easy categorization. Marcia was like a new girlfriend, without the sexual component. I was the little boy that she loved. She was the mom willing to extend to me the unconditional love that I so yearned for. Her only demand was that I be available, and I gave her my time.

The escape was intoxicating. At work, SGI was declining. The company's executives had made a major mistake, chasing the customers with the most demanding problems. It was ego. "We are the best supercomputing company in the world," SGI execs believed, especially after purchasing Cray Supercomputers. But there was a reason Cray was for sale. There weren't enough customers to justify the high research and development costs. Ego had driven the strategy, and now we were all paying the price.

The dream of being a leader and peer of Marc Hannah at a prestigious tech company was slipping away. Professional Services was struggling, and I was struggling in my role. But on the phone with Marcia, I was wanted. I was her son. I mattered.

During our "honeymoon phase," Marcia and Gina talked most mornings, developing their own relationship independent of me. Their connection seemed to complement the one I was building with Marcia, creating a web of relationships that felt, for a time, like they might integrate seamlessly into our family life.

Two Worlds Collapsing - 1997-1998

One morning, driving to work on Highway 101, I complained to Marcia about how judgmental Gina was. I laid out my case: her critiques, her corrections, her standards I could never quite meet.

Marcia readily agreed, coming to the defense of her little boy. "You deserve better than that," she said. "You're doing your best."

Her validation felt like water in a desert. Finally, someone who understood. Someone who saw me the way I wanted to be seen.

I hung up feeling vindicated, pulling into the SGI parking lot with renewed energy.

But that energy didn't last long. Ken Coleman had hired a new Vice President of Professional Services, someone who actually knew what he was doing. In our first meeting, he looked at our offerings, our utilization rates, our revenue projections, and his assessment was clear without him needing to say it: we had no clue what we were doing.

Willie Hooks had told him, "If we fail, he fails, so he'd better make it work." The VP was trying. But I could feel the ground shifting beneath me. This wasn't a technical problem I could code my way out of. This was leadership, strategy, business acumen, all the things I was still learning and failing at in real time.

That evening, I drove home in silence, no call to Marcia on the return trip. I was exhausted.

I walked in the door. Gina was cooking dinner. Maya and Jamil sat at the kitchen table.

"Hi!" I said, trying to sound present.

"Hi Dad," Maya responded, looking up briefly.

Jamil was focused on something else, his attention elsewhere. I took it personally. My own son couldn't even be bothered to greet me.

Gina glanced at me, reading my face, but said nothing. She turned back to the stove.

After dinner, after the kids' homework, after baths and bedtime stories that Gina handled while I sat in the other room, she came downstairs.

"Goodnight," she said. "I'm tired."

Little energy left for me.

I wanted to tell her about my day, about the VP's assessment, about Ken's growing concern, about Willie's warning echoing in my mind. But she was already gone, retreating to the bedroom while I sat alone with my thoughts.

So the next morning, I called Marcia again.

Growing Tensions - All Three Lines Fracturing (1998-1999)

Gina stood by silently as I spoke on the phone to Marcia. While she did not voice her thoughts, her body language spoke volumes. I was pouring myself into my interests yet again, just like coding and searching for Burton, leaving her to take care of the kids.

Gina tired of my lack of attention to the family. She was overwhelmed by the changes that she could neither control nor predict. As a spouse, she supported me, but it was clearly difficult. Love, hate, swings. Exhausting. The unknown of life was playing out for us all.

My obsession with Marcia was creating distance in my primary relationship, though I was too consumed to fully recognize it at the time.

The reunion rippled through the entire family, affecting my children in ways I hadn't fully anticipated. When my four-year-old son Jamil asked Marcia, "How do I know that you won't leave me too?", the innocence and depth of his question struck us all. It revealed how even the youngest members of our family were processing this complicated new relationship, grappling with concepts of permanence and abandonment.

Gina assumed the role of protector of our children's emotions. We all struggled with being Black in a city that was only 3% Black, but now came the additional question: what did it mean for our kids to suddenly have a Jewish grandmother? Gina became the translator, helping our children navigate these complex waters of identity and belonging that had suddenly become even more intricate.

As Marcia's behavior became more unpredictable, Gina spent hours on the phone with her, trying to guide her toward healthier communication patterns. When there were blowups, misperceptions, fears of not being included, lack of respect, Gina would mediate, asking Marcia to pause before exploding. She explained to our children why their Jewish grandmother sometimes disappeared for months. This placed additional emotional labor on Gina's shoulders, managing relationships that were not her own while still dealing with how this new dynamic was affecting our home life.

But Marcia could flip in an instant.

At work, the situation deteriorated. Ken Coleman pulled me aside one day, waiting for the elevator, and his words were direct.

"Derrick," he said, voice low and firm, "we need to talk about your behavior."

"What do you mean?" I asked, already bracing.

"Your anger. Your mistrust of colleagues. Your backbiting comments about Blake. These men are your allies."

"But Ken—"

He cut me off. "You don't lash out just because you feel anger. Know yourself. Control yourself."

The elevator opened, and Ken stepped inside, leaving me shaken.

Shortly after, in 1998, Ken suggested I take a medical leave. Medical leave meant pay with full benefits, a privilege he was extending that I didn't understand. But I didn't need a leave. I needed to leave. I was failing in my job, as was the Professional Services business, and SGI in general. The dream of being a leader and peer of Marc Hannah at a prestigious tech company was gone.

In 1999, I officially left SGI.

Around the same time, Marcia's explosions intensified.

Years after our reunion, I eagerly entered my family history into an online genealogy site and invited relatives to contribute. In my enthusiasm, I included not just my own details, but hers as well, including her past marriages. That was a mistake.

"You are a horrible man!" she shouted, her voice trembling with fury, and something deeper, something older than just this moment.

"Don't call me!" she commanded.

Her email to me afterward revealed the depth of her feelings:

"It was thoughtless of you to provide my personal background information, w/o my input and/or permission, to genealogy websites... My marital/partnership history is no one's business. Please remove them. Please... It's time for us to go our separate ways... Just please leave me and my name and marital history alone and off websites."

Yet even in this message of severance, she signed off, "Love, Marcia."

I was stunned by the intensity of her reaction. What I had seen as a way to connect our family histories, she experienced as a profound violation of her privacy. Her three marriages and divorces were painful chapters in her life, not data points to be cataloged online. In my enthusiasm to document our newly discovered connection, I had inadvertently exposed wounds that were still raw for her.

No apology would satisfy her. And so began a six-month time out.

Other conflicts followed the same pattern. A Christmas card I sent featuring a photo of my adoptive mother triggered another explosive email. I had sent the card without including Marcia. To her, this felt like exclusion, being left out of my family. Mom couldn't be "replaced" - Mom was already there, had always been there. But I hadn't made room for both.

The truth was harder than that. The ups and downs of Marcia were too much. Instead of receiving her unconditional love - the fantasy I'd chased - I decided to push her away, back to the periphery of my life. Still a part of it, but conditioned on my mood. I had learned conditional love from Mom, sought unconditional love from Marcia, and when Marcia's love proved just as conditional, I became what I had always known: someone who conditions love on behavior, on mood, on performance.

Each message from Marcia contained the same whiplash between attack and affection: "You are a MEAN person" followed by "I truly love you." But now I was doing the same to her.

The breaking point came when Marcia sent a particularly harsh email about Maya.

"I've been patient," Gina said, her voice steady but final. "I've tried to understand her pain, I've mediated her conflicts with you, I've explained to our children why their Jewish grandmother sometimes disappears for months. But I will not let her attack our daughter. I'm done. I don't say that lightly. I rarely cut people off, but I am DONE."

During one of our estrangements from Marcia, my phone rang.

"It's for you," Gina said, holding out the receiver. "It's Mom."

"I thought she was calling you these days."

"She was. But I told her she needed to work things out with you directly. I'm not going to be the communication hub for your family anymore. That's not my job, and it's not healthy for any of us."

It wasn't until much later, when my half-sister Cara confided in me, that I fully grasped the depth of Marcia's pain. Cara had distanced herself from me during those rifts, trying to avoid the pressure of justifying our relationship to Marcia.

As all this unfolded, Cara maintained a safe distance. While she did not avoid my overtures to connect, she did not initiate any of her own volition. She later told me, "I would not know when it was safe to mention your name to Marcia. I didn't want to lie, so I simply avoided interacting with you. It had nothing to do with you and me."

This revelation illuminated yet another ripple effect of my complicated relationship with Marcia, how it forced Cara to navigate treacherous emotional waters. Marcia's deep emotional insecurity and constant fear of betrayal isolated her from the people she loved, including Cara, who was caught in the middle of our rocky relationship.

The Dreams Collapse - Recognition (Late 1990s)

In 1999, the VP of Professional Services resigned. Professional Services wasn't growing. As Willie had said, we all succeed or we all fail. Well, we failed.

I was failing at work. I was failing at home. And I was slowly realizing that Marcia wasn't the unconditionally loving mother I had imagined, just as I wasn't the little boy she had fantasized about for 33 years.

When I came home, the response was muted. "Hi Dad." A glance. A nod. After Gina put the kids to bed, there was little energy left for me. "Goodnight, I'm tired."

I had a gradual recognition that Gina had withdrawn. It was not the first time, but I was slowly coming to recognize it as my distractions disappeared. Marcia had turned out to be another escape, just like coding, just like searching for Burton. Both obsessions provided abstract problems to solve instead of being present with my family.

My family needed me to perform each and every day. Though my kids did not tell me to my face that I was failing, I knew I was.

Learning and Growing

Over the years, my heart ached for Marcia. She was tragically insecure, always on guard for the next imagined betrayal. My son Jamil once remarked, "How could she be any different?" That question unlocked a new understanding for me, one that led me straight to empathy.

I saw parts of myself in Marcia. I, too, am sensitive to feeling excluded or ignored. I remember times when I would be talking to someone, only for another person to walk up, ignore me, and take over the conversation. I often blamed those moments on racism, which only fueled my anger. This interpretation wasn't necessarily wrong, racism certainly played a role in some of these interactions, but focusing solely on external factors sometimes prevented me from examining my own sensitivities and reactions.

Marcia took it even further, transforming her anger into verbal attacks. Where I might withdraw or seethe silently, she would lash out, burning bridges with those closest to her. Recognizing this pattern in her helped me see echoes of my own tendencies toward oversensitivity and withdrawal, prompting me to work on healthier responses to feeling excluded or overlooked.

In the aftermath of our turbulent relationship, I made a promise to myself: I would confront my own relationship issues directly. I refused to repeat the cycles of enrapture and estrangement that had defined Marcia's life.

The strain with Marcia had lasting effects on my marriage that Gina and I never addressed directly. As I emotionally neglected the kids during my obsession with Marcia, Gina's role as protector broadened. She filled the void I created, becoming their primary emotional anchor. Worse, when I later attempted to engage in disciplining, I perceived her as an impediment. Reaching agreement on how to parent became harder and harder. The ripple effects of my relationship with Marcia had created fault lines in our family structure that would take years to fully understand.

Time softened the sharpest edges, and in their place, understanding took root.

Meeting Marcia didn't just answer questions about my origins; it revealed patterns I'd inherited or adopted. Her intense need for belonging mirrored my own. Her explosive responses to exclusion echoed my own tendencies to withdraw or classify people as enemies. Most revealing was recognizing my pattern of pouring myself into obsessions, coding, searching for Burton, now Marcia, as a way to avoid family responsibilities and emotional complexity.

It was the same disconnection I felt during our first meeting, present physically while emotionally hovering at a distance. I'd developed this skill long before meeting Marcia: retreating to abstract, emotion-free worlds like writing software, where logic prevailed and messy feelings couldn't intrude. In these spaces, I knew exactly what would happen when I typed a command. People, relationships, emotions, these were unpredictable, uncontrollable. So I spent as much time as possible in environments I could manage, where the stakes felt high but the emotional demands remained low.

The way I managed my relationships with Mom and Marcia, calling Mom weekly while speaking with Marcia daily without telling Mom, reflected perhaps my most refined skill: compartmentalization. Throughout my life, I've separated different aspects of my identity and experiences into distinct mental containers that rarely interact. This ability served as both strength and weakness, allowing me to function in multiple worlds but preventing the integration necessary for wholeness.

Marcia and I never had the effortless comfort that exists between my Mom and me, that relationship built on decades of daily care and unconditional love. But we have forged something meaningful in its own right, a connection that honors both our biological bond and the complex history that separated and eventually reunited us.

Understanding Marcia helped me understand myself: where I'd come from, where I was stuck, and where I still had room to grow. That awareness didn't erase the past, but it offered something harder to come by: the clarity to parent differently, to love more bravely, to remain present even when emotions ran high.
