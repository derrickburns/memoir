Chapter 15: The Letter

**Late January 1990**

Sunday morning sunlight filtered through our kitchen blinds. Gina pushed her untouched toast away and sipped water instead of coffee.

"You okay?" I asked, glancing up from the newspaper.

"Not really."

When she emerged from the bathroom, her face was pale, holding a white plastic stick with a small window in its center.

"I'm pregnant."

The kitchen clock ticked. Five, six, seven seconds of silence.

"Say something," she whispered.

My mouth went dry.

"You're sure?"

Inside, I screamed: "A baby! I am a grad student. I am not ready!"

"That's wonderful," I exclaimed!

My hand reached for hers, squeezing with an actor's precision.

**Late March 1990**

After Gina's first prenatal visit, the reality was settling in. Seven months from now, we would have a baby.

Then Mom forwarded the envelope without ceremony, no phone call to prepare me, just her neat handwriting on the package with my California address. The postmark: March 22, 1990. Inside, official letterhead from the Detroit Probate Court.

My throat tightened as I unfolded the pages.

The report revealed two startling truths: I was born to a Jewish woman and a black man in 1964 Detroit, a product of two distinct cultural traditions that had somehow found each other across racial boundaries rarely crossed in that era.

I read and reread the description of my birth father:

---

*She said he was born in 1938 of Negro parentage in Michigan and reared in the Episcopalian faith. He is described as a 6' 2" tall young man, slim, and very good looking, and altogether very personable. He is said to have friends and, as noted above, his achievements are outstanding. He presently feels very rejected by his mother. He is the only boy in the family. He has an older sister.*

*After completing high school he enrolled at a prestigious white university out-of-state and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts cum laude. He subsequently completed his law degree at another prestigious university. He is presently in private practice.*

---

As a Princeton graduate who grew up in Michigan, I correctly translated "prestigious white university out-of-state" to mean an Ivy League university. Harvard, probably. Maybe Yale. But I missed a crucial clue in the next line. "Another prestigious university" did not necessarily mean another Ivy League school. The writer had specifically mentioned "out-of-state" for the undergraduate degree but omitted it when describing the law school—a detail that would prove decisive years later.

For a person who had grown up fielding constant questions about "what" I was, this report wasn't just data. It was affirmation. The ambiguity that had followed me through childhood playgrounds and college campuses wasn't a mistake; it was a deliberate combination of specific people with specific histories.

All my life, I'd navigated questions about my light skin, straight hair, and hazel eyes, only to discover that my heritage was more complex than I'd imagined. I'd spent my life like a puzzle piece that didn't quite fit in any box, edges too rounded here, too sharp there, only to discover I belonged to a different puzzle altogether.

I set the letter down on my desk, next to the stack of SIGGRAPH papers I'd been reviewing. Two different kinds of information, both asking me to judge, to assess, to understand patterns.

That night, lying in bed, Gina already asleep beside me, I thought about the convergence. Just weeks ago, we'd learned we were having a baby. Now this letter describing a 6'2" Black lawyer who'd graduated from an Ivy League school. A Jewish woman. Two people who'd somehow found each other in 1963 Detroit.

In seven months, I would become a father. And I still didn't know who my father was.

**April 28, 1990**

The wedding photos show chosen family assembled: groomsmen Patrick, James Raby, James Latham, Hugh, Dave, Vince. Bridesmaids Brenda, Cheryl, Dayna, June Cross, Wendy. Mom and Dad in the front row, beaming.

Gina's dress. My tuxedo. Two families becoming one.

Seven weeks since that probate court letter had arrived. I was building my own family while carrying questions about the families I'd never known.

**Summer 1990**

At SGI, I belonged without explanation. No performance required, no "What are you?" questions to navigate. Just my mind, my code, my contributions.

Marc Hannah had co-founded this 3D graphics powerhouse. We shared the Bell Labs scholarship, Stanford, being Black men from the Midwest. He'd gotten me the summer job that led here. Walking past offices filled with his revolutionary graphics machines, I felt connected to something larger than myself. Here was a model of what was possible—not just technical excellence, but building something that mattered. I wanted to be Marc, and short of that, to live up to the standard he'd set.

That summer, reviewing papers for SIGGRAPH—the Olympics of computer graphics—my expertise was recognized without question.

Professional belonging felt complete.

But it couldn't fill the gaps in personal identity that Maya's birth would expose.

**October 11, 1990**

When they placed Maya in my arms, time suspended.

A full head of hair crowned her tiny face, eyes finding mine with an intensity that felt like recognition. Her tiny fingers wrapped around my index finger with the gravity of a question I wasn't yet ready to answer.

For the first time, I saw a face like mine.

As an adopted child with no biological mirrors in my family, this connection hit me with unexpected force. Growing up as a "mixed" child had been like being an extraterrestrial visitor, dropped into humanity without a clear lineage. Questions of "What are you?" had always haunted me, not from a place of racial identity, but from a deeper alienation of seeming to lack visible roots.

Now, looking at Maya, I finally had an answer to the lifelong question "What are you?"

I am her father.

Her features echoed mine, a biological connection that anchored me to Earth in a way I'd never before experienced.

At nine months, Maya was walking.

But what Maya's birth awakened in me was something I couldn't have predicted. Seven months earlier, that probate court letter had arrived. Now, holding my daughter, I understood viscerally what had only been abstract before.

Somewhere out there was a man who had held me like this. Or maybe he hadn't. Maybe he'd never known I existed. And somewhere was a woman who had felt me move inside her, had given birth to me, had looked at my face and then...

Given me away.

The questions I'd carried my whole life weren't just about me anymore. They were about her. About what I would tell Maya when she asked where she came from. How could I answer when I didn't know where I came from?

**Christmas 1990**

The photo from Christmas Day shows us all gathered: standing in back were Uncle Bubba, Mom, and me. In front: Dave and his wife Renee, Gina, Cille, Aunt Mildred, and Dad.

Dave was there, part of the family circle, though we didn't yet know he was beginning his journey to becoming Jala.

Gina held two-month-old Maya.

I stood behind them all, smiling for the camera, part of this chosen family that had raised me and loved me. Building my own family with Gina and Maya. Working at a company where a Black man's innovation had paved the way for mine.

But in my desk drawer at home sat that probate court letter. And in the law libraries between Mountain View and Redwood City, I was beginning a search that would consume the next seven years.

The questions that had followed me my whole life—What are you? Where do you come from?—weren't going away just because I'd built a good life.

If anything, Maya's birth had made them more urgent.

Looking at her face, I saw my face. But I still didn't know where that face came from. Who the 6'2" Black lawyer was. Who the Jewish woman was. Why they'd let me go.

And I wouldn't rest until I knew.

**Redwood City Law Library - Saturday, March 1991**

The fluorescent lights hummed as I turned another page in the Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory. My cold coffee sat forgotten. The tiny font blurred after hours of reading.

Michigan lawyers. Born 1938. Ivy League undergrad. Law degree from "another prestigious university." In private practice.

Several matched all the criteria—but only if they practiced in Detroit. What if he'd moved to Grand Rapids? Lansing? Ann Arbor? I'd have to check every Michigan lawyer born around 1938 with the right credentials.

My finger traced down another column. How could I narrow this? Look for a "Black" name? That felt wrong, unreliable. Call each one? No. I couldn't think about that now. One step at a time. Just find candidates first.

The librarian appeared at my table. "We're closing."

5 PM. Seven hours had passed.

I drove home with my notes beside me. Seven names. Seven possibilities.

Gina was in the kitchen when I walked in. I told her about my process, the careful elimination, the possibilities. "Seven names," I said, unable to contain the excitement. "Maybe I found him!"

Her face remained stoic as she continued fixing dinner.

Maya played with blocks on the floor between us, building towers and knocking them down, building and knocking down, over and over.

Gina didn't ask to see the names. She just kept chopping vegetables, her knife hitting the cutting board in steady rhythm.
