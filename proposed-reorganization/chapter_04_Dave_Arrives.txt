Chapter 4: Dave Arrives

**The Loneliest Desk**

The wooden desk felt too big for me, like everything else in Mrs. Bridget's second-grade class. Multiplication tables marched across the blackboard in neat white rows. Seven times eight. My hand shot up before I could stop it, fingers stretching toward the ceiling tiles.

"Ooh, ooh!" The sound escaped my throat like a trapped bird.

Mrs. Bridget's chalk paused mid-stroke.

"Yes, Derrick?"

"Fifty-six!" The answer burst out, sweet relief flooding through me like when you finally scratch an itch.

"Very good." Her smile was warm, but behind me came the whispers, sharp as pins.

"Teacher's pet!" "Show-off!" "Think you're so smart..."

I slid lower in my seat, trying to fold myself smaller. The wood grain on my desk became fascinating - little rivers and valleys I could trace with my finger. But then Mrs. Bridget's chalk tapped against the board again: "12 x 9."

My arm betrayed me again, shooting up like it had a mind of its own. One hundred and eight screamed in my head, demanding to be let out.

Each correct answer I gave seemed to add another brick to an invisible wall growing between my desk and everyone else's. When the final bell rang, I waited until the scraping of chairs and shuffling of feet faded away. Better that way. No one to "accidentally" bump into me or whisper those names that followed me like shadows.

Outside, the afternoon sun hit me like a spotlight. Kids clustered in noisy groups on the front steps, planning after-school adventures or waiting for older siblings. Glenn caught my eye and waved, but he was already surrounded by his usual crowd, his big brother Dennis standing nearby. At least there was one familiar face from the neighborhood in my new class, even if we only shared quick waves.

I started the walk home, scuffing my shoes against the sidewalk. Each step taking me further from school made my shoulders feel lighter, but home wasn't the safe place it should have been. Instead, it was just a different kind of lonely - quieter, but somehow louder in its silence.

**After School Emptiness**

"Who is it?" Cille asked as she pulled back the white lace curtain to see my face.

"It's me!"

"Your snack is on the table. And don't forget to take off those shoes - I just mopped that floor!" she said, heading downstairs to resume her ironing.

I carefully placed my shoes on the newspaper behind the door. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich waited on a paper towel, cut diagonally just the way I liked it. Next to it sat a glass of milk, beads of condensation rolling down the sides.

After I finished, I headed downstairs to watch Cille press sheets with precise, practiced movements. The iron hissed as she worked near Dad's bowling trophies while the small kitchen TV blared with Doctor Tom Horton dealing with another crisis at University Hospital.

"How was school?" she asked, not looking up from her ironing.

"Fine."

"Can we play gin rummy later?" I asked hopefully. Cille was the only grown-up who never seemed too busy to play cards, even if she did show no mercy when it came to winning.

"After my stories," she promised, warmth in her voice. "And after you do your homework. Mrs. Burns would have my hide if I let you play cards before your school work's done."

At 3:30, I'd head to the den for my shows - The Three Stooges, Little Rascals, Land of The Lost, Star Trek. The TV Guide was my constant companion, the schedule etched into my mind like a prayer. But when my favorite shows ended and the screen went dark, the silence would crash in like a wave, leaving me stranded in the emptiness of our house.

Dad's arrival at 4:30 PM was both comfort and fresh disappointment. I'd watch him settle into his chair after changing clothes, newspaper crackling as he unfolded it like a shield between us.

"Dad, want to play cards?" I'd ask, hope rising in my chest.

"Let me finish the paper first," he'd say, but the paper never seemed to end before dinnertime.

Mom was no better refuge.

"Mom, can we play a game?"

"I need to cook dinner, Derrick," came the tired reply.

So I'd retreat to my solitary games - Solitaire, a game whose very name mocked my loneliness, or jacks bouncing against empty floor, or Hot Wheels cars racing to nowhere.

**Breaking Point**

One Saturday afternoon, the weight of solitude finally crushed through my defenses.

"I'm lonely!" The words burst from me like water through a broken dam. "I want a brother!"

Mom and Dad exchanged one of those long, heavy looks adults share when they're speaking without words. Their concern hung in the air like smoke, but neither seemed to know how to clear it.

I could see something shifting behind their eyes - Mom's teacher-brain already working on the problem, Dad's quiet consideration weighing options I couldn't imagine.

"We hear you, baby," Mom said softly, her hand finding my shoulder. "Let us think about this."

**The Mysterious David**

"Derrick, I have arranged a playdate for you tomorrow," Mom announced one evening, her voice carrying an unusual note of anticipation.

"Who?" I asked.

"David," she responded, the name hanging in the air like a mystery.

"David Ragland?" I ventured, thinking of the boy Mom sometimes mentioned from her school.

"No, a different David. He will be here at 5 PM," she said in that same careful tone she used when telling us about important things.

Something in Mom's voice made me pause. Who was this David? The way she said "a different David" felt weighted with meaning she wasn't sharing.

**First Meeting**

When David arrived, he was smaller than me, with curly black hair and brown eyes as big as quarters. Mom suggested we go into the basement to play. At first, he seemed to shrink under Mom's schoolteacher voice as she laid out the rules - no roughhousing, no yelling, clean up when you're finished.

But then something magical happened. As we started to play, his whole face transformed. His smile lit up like a lamp being switched on, and his laughter made our basement feel warmer somehow.

We built fortresses with my blocks, creating elaborate worlds with moats and bridges and secret passages. We raced Hot Wheels cars across the vinyl tile floor, thrilled each time they crashed into the wall. For the first time in what felt like years, the house didn't echo with emptiness anymore.

When it was time for David to leave, he looked back over his shoulder at me, like he didn't want the afternoon to end either.

"Can David come back?" I asked Mom after he left.

"Yes," she said, and something in her smile told me this had been more than just a playdate.

**Growing Connection**

David's visits became more frequent, and somewhere along the way, he became "Dave." Each time he came over, the basement felt less like my lonely refuge and more like our special place. We'd spend hours down there, huddled on the basement floor around the train set Dad had built.

Sometimes when I asked Dave about where he lived before, his face would change - like when you accidentally step on something sharp and try not to show it hurts.

"Mrs. Williams was okay," he'd say, but the way he said "okay" didn't sound like okay at all. It sounded careful, like walking on ice.

I learned not to ask about her anymore. Even at seven, I could tell some doors were better left closed.

The Santa Fe engine puffed tiny clouds as it rounded the curve. Dave's eyes lit up as he reached for the transformer dial.

"Faster?" he asked.

"Yeah!" I nodded, both of us grinning as the train picked up speed.

We took turns adjusting the speed, laughing as the train zipped past the station and rumbled over the bridge. The smell of the "smoke" and the soft hum of the motor made it feel like we were running a real railroad, completely lost in the magic of our miniature world.

During one visit, we discovered my white upright toy piano - the Christmas gift from when I was five. We'd coax melodies from the keys, making up songs that only we understood, filling the basement with music and laughter.

But the best part was simply having someone to talk to, someone who listened to my ideas for games and added his own. Dave had this way of making everything more fun, more interesting, more alive.

**The Question**

Then one day, after Dave had been visiting for weeks, Mom asked me the question that would change everything.

"Would you like Dave to stay here?"

"Yes!" The word burst from me before I could even think, like it had been waiting there all along.

That evening, Dave and I were in the basement, trying to teach my toy piano to play "Chopsticks," when Dad descended the stairs wearing that special smile that made his whole face soft.

He crouched down next to Dave, and in a gentle voice asked, "Would you like to live here with us?"

Dave's face bloomed with joy.

"Yes!" he shouted, and my heart soared with his answer.

The lonely boy who'd begged for a brother was disappearing, replaced by someone new: a big brother.

**Becoming Brothers**

My bedroom transformed - now twin beds stood where one had been. At night, defying Mom's explicit instructions, we'd push those beds together, creating our own island in the darkness. We barely dared to whisper, knowing Mom's sharp ears could detect the smallest sound, but Dave's presence beside me was comfort enough.

The night didn't feel so big anymore.

Like a tour guide showing off my favorite city, I introduced Dave to my world - to Glenn and the neighborhood kids, to the secret spots where adventure lived. Dave had this magic about him; his kind face and ready laugh drew people in. While I could ace any test the teachers threw at me, Dave could make friends as easily as breathing.

Walking to school together, the path didn't seem as treacherous anymore. Glenn had his big brother Dennis for protection. Now I was a big brother too, and that title came with a responsibility that felt both heavy and wonderful on my shoulders.

"Come on, Dave," I'd say, reaching for his hand as we crossed the street. "I'll show you the best way to get to the playground."

At home, our afternoon routines shifted too. Instead of solitary games and empty silence, there was constant chatter, shared adventures, someone to build pillow forts with during commercials.

"Derrick! Dave! Dinner!" Mom would call, and we'd thunder up the basement stairs together, bringing our laughter with us into the kitchen.

**Sunday Mornings, Doubled**

Sunday breakfast became an even grander affair with Dave at the table. He'd watch in amazement as Mom piled pancakes high, his eyes widening at the abundance of food, the easy warmth of our family routines.

At church, I'd sit a little straighter knowing Dave was beside me. When Mrs. Johnson asked about my "little brother," the words felt natural, true, important.

"This is Dave," I'd say proudly, my hand on his shoulder. "He's my brother."

The congregation embraced him immediately, the way they'd embraced me years before. He was part of our family now, which meant he was part of their extended family too.

**Refuge, Shared**

A few weeks after Dave moved in, Friday evening arrived with its familiar promise. Mom packed our overnight bags.

"Where are we going?" Dave asked, eyes wide with uncertainty.

"To Aunt Mae's," I said, grinning. "You're going to love it."

When we arrived at 18606 Mackay, the screen door creaked open and Aunt Mae's voice rang out: "Shug!" She wrapped me in her vanilla-scented hug, then turned to Dave with arms spread equally wide. "And here's my other Shug!"

Dave's face transformed - the same way it had that first day in our basement. He melted into her embrace like he'd been waiting his whole life for it.

That afternoon, we made ice cream together - all three of us. When it came time to crank, I grasped the wooden handle.

"Want to help?" I asked Dave.

He nodded eagerly, his small hands joining mine. We cranked together, laughing at first, then straining as the handle got harder to turn.

That's when Aunt Mae's hands covered both of ours.

"We're almost there, Shugs," she said softly. Together - all six hands on that wooden handle - we pushed through until the crank wouldn't turn anymore.

"We did it together," Aunt Mae said, smiling at both of us.

Dave's face shone with something I recognized: the feeling of being invited in, of contributing something that mattered, of hands covering yours when the work got too hard.

Dave had found refuge too.

**The Gift of Brotherhood**

That first night with Dave in the twin bed beside mine, I lay awake listening to his breathing, steady, trusting, unaware that he'd just saved me from a loneliness I hadn't known how to name. The empty spaces in our house that had echoed with my solitary footsteps now hummed with shared whispers, muffled laughter, the simple presence of someone who belonged to me the way I belonged to him.

Not by blood, but by choice, by love, by the simple miracle of two lonely people finding each other and deciding to build something together.

Those first months with Dave felt like waking up from a long sleep. The house was full of life now - two boys racing cars, building towers, arguing over TV shows, sharing secrets in the darkness after bedtime.

Mom and Dad watched us with something like wonder, seeing how we'd transformed each other. I was no longer the isolated smart kid eating alone at the kitchen table. Dave was no longer wherever he'd been before he came to us.

We were brothers.

For now, that was enough. More than enough.

It was everything.
