Chapter 22: Acceptance From Beyond (1999-2006)

**1999 - Taking Stock**

I left SGI in 1999 with boxes of books, underwater stock options, and a severance package that felt more like consolation prize than reward.

My relationship with Marcia had become a rollercoaster—intense honeymoon phase followed by explosive conflicts, cycles of enrapture and estrangement that exhausted everyone around us.

Gina had drawn her line after Marcia's harsh email about Maya. "I'm done," she'd said, her voice steady but final. And she meant it.

At home, the damage was visible. Gina had withdrawn emotionally. When I came in from work each day, the response was muted: "Hi Dad." A glance. A nod. After she put the kids to bed, there was little energy left for me. "Goodnight, I'm tired."

I had a gradual recognition that the distractions I'd used to avoid presence—coding, searching for Burton, obsessing over Marcia—had all collapsed or revealed themselves as escapes from the real work of being present with my family.

Three major threads of my life had unraveled:

**Professional:** SGI was over. The dream of being Marc Hannah's peer at a prestigious tech company had died. I was unemployed, looking for redemption in a Valley that had already moved on from interactive television to the internet I'd been too afraid to help build.

**Family:** My marriage was strained beyond recognition. I'd emotionally neglected my kids during my obsession with Marcia. Gina had filled the void I created, becoming their primary emotional anchor. Now when I tried to engage in parenting, I perceived her as an impediment. Reaching agreement on how to parent had become harder and harder.

**Birth parent search:** I'd found Burton's name only to discover he'd died in 1971. I'd found Marcia only to discover that her love was just as conditional as Mom's had been, just as volatile and demanding. The fantasy of unconditional love from a birth mother had shattered against reality.

But amid all this wreckage, something unexpected happened. Karen continued to call. Sporadic but genuine. No agenda, no demands, just curiosity and connection.

And over time, through Karen, I began to understand something about family that I'd missed my entire life.

**1999-2002 - Relationship With Karen Develops**

After our first meeting at Fishbones in 1997, Karen and I settled into a rhythm that suited us both. Occasional phone calls. Holiday cards. Sporadically shared family news.

Nothing intense. Nothing demanding. Just... connection.

"How are Maya and Jamil?" she'd ask.

"Good. Maya's reading everything she can get her hands on. Jamil's building increasingly complex Lego structures."

"They sound like Goldens," she'd say, and I'd hear the smile in her voice.

What struck me about Karen was how different she was from Marcia. Where Marcia flipped between idealization and rage, Karen remained steady. Where Marcia demanded constant attention and reassurance, Karen gave space. Where Marcia saw exclusion in every Christmas card I sent featuring Mom, Karen understood that I had multiple families and that wasn't a betrayal of any of them.

Karen had her own life—successful legal career, nieces she adored, a full existence that didn't revolve around our connection. But she made room for me in that life without demanding I fill a void she'd carried for decades.

It was, I realized slowly, what healthy family connection looked like.

**The ALMA Discovery - Understanding the System**

Somewhere in the late 1990s, during one of my research binges, I discovered the Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association (ALMA). The excitement stirred the same feelings I'd felt years earlier when I found the Bell Labs scholarship.

Founded in 1971 by fellow adoptee Florence Fisher, ALMA was one of the earliest and most vocal advocates for adoptees' rights in America.

What moved me wasn't the discovery of other adoptees—I had known many throughout my childhood. What struck me was finding a movement, a collective voice demanding change. Here were adults like me who had grown up loved and cherished, yet still felt entitled to know their origins.

The notion that feeling loved and wanting to know your biological history weren't contradictory finally made sense. I wasn't betraying Mom and Dad by searching. I was claiming a right that shouldn't have been denied in the first place.

As I reviewed ALMA's materials, I gained perspective on why finding my birth parents had been so difficult. My birth in 1964 had placed me at the center of multiple colliding social forces, during a moment when adoption practices were beginning to shift but hadn't yet transformed.

**Michigan's "Donut Hole" Period**

Michigan's adoption laws created what advocates called a "donut hole" period, affecting adoptees born between May 28, 1945, and September 12, 1980.

While adoptees born before or after this period could access their original birth certificates unless a birth parent explicitly objected, those of us caught in this window faced a different reality. We needed each birth parent to have proactively filed a statement of consent with the Central Adoption Registry, or we'd need to pursue a court order—a bureaucratic mountain designed to be nearly impossible to climb.

The absurdity was stunning. I'd spent years navigating legal directories, probate courts, intermediaries, confidential searches—all because I'd been born in the wrong 35-year window.

ALMA's lobbying efforts revealed crucial changes to Michigan's adoption laws, particularly Section 710.27, which defined "recognizable information." The law created an absurd paradox: requests for records must not reveal personal details, yet were required to disclose all non-identifying data.

This revelation led to an important insight: the report I'd received in 1990 couldn't be the original document, as it was printed in a modern typeface. Someone had retyped it, raising the question: what hidden details might the original document contain that had been deemed too identifying to share?

Understanding this system—the bureaucratic maze intentionally designed to keep adoptees from their own histories—transformed my anger. It wasn't just personal failure that had delayed my search for seven years. It was systemic obstruction.

This knowledge didn't undo the pain, but it contextualized it. I wasn't uniquely incompetent at searching. The system was uniquely competent at hiding.

**2000-2005 - Dad's Witnessing**

During visits to Detroit throughout these years, Dad's approach to my search remained constant.

"Any news?" he'd ask, genuine curiosity in his voice.

He never made my search about him. Never acted threatened or insecure. His questions weren't tinged with defensiveness but with the same engaged intelligence he brought to everything.

What I appreciated most was how Dad never made me feel that searching for my birth father reflected poorly on him as my dad. He was witnessing my journey, not competing with it.

During these visits, sitting in the living room where I'd grown up, I'd sometimes catch him watching me with an expression I couldn't quite define—not concern, exactly, but quiet assessment.

In those moments, I realized Dad was witnessing my search not as rejection of my upbringing, but as extension of the independent thinking he and Mom had always encouraged.

Mom's approach was different. She rarely revealed vulnerability, and my intuition suggested that her brave suggestion to search years ago had stemmed more from a sense of parental duty than personal desire. Her pragmatism had always been her strength and her shield.

I found myself protecting her emotions just as she had always protected mine. We didn't talk about Marcia. We didn't talk about Burton. We talked about Maya and Jamil, about Gina's work at Kaiser, about the weather and the Lions and whether I was eating well.

Their unspoken support—Dad's curious witnessing, Mom's protective distance—allowed me freedom to search without the burden of their feelings. A final parenting gift I only recognized years later.

**2003-2005 - Marcia's Cycles Continue**

The relationship with Marcia continued its pattern: months of daily calls and intimacy, followed by explosive conflicts over perceived slights, followed by estrangements lasting months, followed by tentative reconnection.

A Christmas card featuring Mom. An online genealogy entry including her marital history. A perceived exclusion from a family event. Each triggered the same cycle.

Her emails whiplashed between attack and affection: "You are a MEAN person" followed by "I truly love you."

But I'd stopped trying to fix it. Stopped trying to win her unconditional love. Stopped trying to be the perfect son who would finally earn what I'd been seeking my whole life.

Instead, I'd learned to create boundaries. To expect the cycles. To protect Maya and Jamil from the volatility. To let Gina draw her line and respect it.

The fantasy of unconditional love from a birth mother had died. What remained was a complicated, conditional relationship with a wounded woman who'd given me away at 23 and never fully recovered from that choice.

I came to understand later, through my own therapy and reflection, that Marcia and I had both been seeking the same thing from each other: the fantasy version that would heal old wounds. She wanted the baby boy she'd lost, frozen at the moment of relinquishment. I wanted the mother who would love me without conditions, without demands, without the volatility that made connection feel dangerous.

Neither of those people existed. We were both real, flawed humans who'd found each other 33 years too late to be what we'd imagined.

But Karen—Karen was real. Present. Steady. And that mattered more than I'd recognized.

**2006 - The Call**

In 2006, nine years after our first contact, Karen called with news.

"My mother passed away," she said, her voice gentle with grief.

"I'm so sorry," I said, and meant it. Phyllis had been difficult, hostile even, when I'd first reached out. But she was Karen's mother. And she was my aunt.

"There's something else," Karen continued. "She left you something in her will."

I sat down, stunned. "She what?"

"A bequest. She wanted you to have something from the family."

The revelation struck me deeply. Phyllis, who had initially feared I had financial motives for finding my birth father, had left me a bequest.

This transformation had happened largely beyond my view, revealed only through Karen's occasional comments over the years. "She asked about you, you know," Karen had mentioned the previous Christmas. "Wanted to know how your kids were doing in school."

The bequest, modest financially but immeasurable in meaning, testified to a private journey Phyllis had undertaken since our difficult early calls. She had traveled from rejection to acceptance, from suspicion to acknowledgment.

More than money, she had quietly written me into the family narrative she had guarded so carefully for decades.

**The Acceptance**

"I can't accept it," I said to Karen. "It doesn't feel right. I never wanted money from your family."

"I know you didn't," Karen said. "The amount is insignificant, Derrick. It won't change my life. But it was her wish for you to have something from the family. She wanted you to know you belonged."

That last sentence broke through my resistance.

She wanted you to know you belonged.

Despite my initial awkwardness, I realized this was a clear sign of acceptance from both Karen and Phyllis. It symbolized that I did belong.

"Okay," I said quietly. "Thank you. And thank you for... everything. For reaching out when your mother wouldn't. For staying in touch all these years. For just... being steady."

"You're family," Karen said simply. "That's what family does."

After we hung up, I sat in my home office, surrounded by family photos. Maya and Jamil's school portraits. Wedding pictures. Snapshots from family vacations.

Among them now stood a small framed photo Phyllis had given me years ago: my father Burton as a young boy, sitting on the lap of Joe Louis, the "Brown Bomber," his expression seeking, open, and inquisitive.

I looked at that photo with new eyes. Burton had died in 1971, when I was seven. I'd never meet him. Never hear his voice. Never know if his analytical mind worked like mine, if his struggles mirrored mine, if he would have been proud of who I'd become.

But Phyllis, in her final act, had written me into the story. Had acknowledged that I was Burton's son. Had accepted that I belonged to this family, even if I'd found them 26 years too late to meet my father.

**Coming Full Circle**

The journey to find my birth father had taken me from microfilm readers to court documents, from disappointment to discovery, from isolation to connection.

What began as a search for medical information had evolved into something far more profound: a quest to understand the complex tapestry of heritage and circumstance that had shaped my existence.

What I found was both less and more than I had imagined:

Not a living man, but a legacy.
Not answers to all my questions, but a family connection I hadn't known I was missing.
Not the unconditional love I'd fantasized about, but real, complicated, conditional relationships with flawed humans who'd written me into their story.

I'd found my birth father's name: William Burton Golden. Harvard College 1960, University of Michigan Law School 1963. Dead at 32, seven years before I started searching for him.

I'd found my birth mother: Marcia Rene Rosenberg. Stunningly beautiful in her 1958 yearbook photo. Four blocks from my high school the whole time. As wounded and seeking as I was, offering conditional love that felt familiar because it mirrored the conditional love I'd learned from Mom.

I'd found my aunt Phyllis: initially hostile, protective of her brother's legacy, afraid I was after something from her family. Who'd gradually softened, asked about me at holidays, finally written me into her will as acknowledgment that I belonged.

And I'd found Karen: steady, analytical, fair-minded. Who'd reached out when her mother wouldn't. Who'd given space when I needed it, connection when I sought it, and family without demands or conditions.

**July 4, 1997 - The Village Photo**

There was a photo from July 4, 1997—just weeks after I'd first met Marcia—that captured something I hadn't understood at the time.

"My village," the caption would later read.

Standing in the back row: Jala (Dave, who'd transitioned and was living her truth), Gina, Renee (Jala's wife), Aunt Mildred, Aunt Vivian, Erika, Mary, Marcia, Phyllis.

Sitting in front: Joshua (Jala's son), Dad, Jessica, Mom, me, Jamil, Maya, Mary's middle child.

All of them together. Birth family and adoptive family. Chosen family and blood family. The people who raised me and the people who gave me away and later reclaimed me.

At the time, I'd thought this photo represented integration—all my worlds coming together in one frame.

What I didn't see then was the strain holding it together. Marcia's discomfort standing next to Mom. Phyllis's guarded expression. Gina's exhaustion from mediating between families. The performance of unity that wouldn't survive the cycles to come.

But Karen wasn't in that photo. She'd maintained distance during the early volatile years, waiting to see if the relationship would stabilize.

And in a way, that distance—her refusal to perform unity that didn't exist yet—was the healthiest response of all.

**2006 - What I Learned**

By 2006, twelve years after Maya's birth had catalyzed this search, I'd learned what I needed to know:

**Where I came from:** Burton and Marcia. Harvard and Mumford High. Black and Jewish. Lawyer and English teacher. Two brilliant, wounded people who'd found each other briefly in 1963 Detroit, created me, and then let me go.

**Who I looked like:** Marcia's hazel eyes. Burton's height and build. The Golden family's analytical mind. Features I'd carried my whole life without knowing their source.

**What I'd inherited:** Not just physical traits, but emotional architecture. Marcia's guarded approach to vulnerability. The careful, measured reaching out. The sensitivity to exclusion. The tendency to compartmentalize. Patterns I'd thought were mine alone turned out to be genetic inheritance.

**What I hadn't inherited:** Unconditional love. Easy belonging. Simple answers. The fantasy of bio-family that would finally make me whole.

**What I gained:** Karen's steady presence. Phyllis's posthumous acceptance. Burton's photo with Joe Louis. Marcia's complicated, conditional connection. Context for questions I'd carried since childhood.

**What I lost:** The fantasy. The belief that finding my birth parents would answer the question "Who am I?" The hope that biological connection would provide what adoptive connection hadn't.

**What remained:** Two families. Chosen and biological. Mom and Dad, who raised me with conditional love that taught me to perform excellence. Burton and Marcia, who created me and gave me away. Phyllis and Karen, who initially rejected me, then accepted me. Gina and Maya and Jamil, who needed me to stop performing and start being present.

All of them real. All of them flawed. All of them mine.

**The Answer I Didn't Expect**

For seven years, I'd searched for the answer to "Who am I?"

I thought finding Burton's name and Marcia's face would provide it.

But the answer didn't come from discovering where I came from. It came from learning to be present with where I was.

The answer wasn't in legal directories or yearbook photos or DNA or family photos. It was in the hard work of integration. Of learning to be present instead of performing. Of building bridges instead of walls. Of choosing connection over compartmentalization.

Phyllis's bequest wasn't about money. It was about acceptance from beyond. A woman who'd initially rejected me had traveled her own journey toward acknowledging I belonged. She'd done it privately, quietly, without fanfare or demand.

And in her final act, she'd written me into the story I'd been seeking my whole life.

Not as the central character.
Not as the hero or the victim.
Just as someone who belonged. Who had a place. Who was part of the complicated, messy, beautiful reality of family.

That was enough.

It had to be enough.

Because the search was over.

And the real work—learning to be present, to connect, to love without conditions, to parent Maya and Jamil not as performances but as authentic relationship—was just beginning.

Acceptance from beyond had given me permission to stop searching backward and start building forward.

To stop asking "Where did I come from?" and start asking "Where am I going?"

To stop performing belonging and start creating it.

That was Phyllis's final gift. And I was finally ready to receive it.
