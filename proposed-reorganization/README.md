# Proposed Reorganization - Draft of New Chapter Structure

**Date Created:** 2025-11-14
**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting author approval

## What This Directory Contains

This directory contains the **PROPOSED** reorganization of childhood chapters 3-6 to give Dave's arrival proper emotional weight.

## The Change

**Current (Google Doc):** 7 childhood chapters
**Proposed:** 8 childhood chapters

### What's Different

**Chapters 1-2:** UNCHANGED (use finalized versions from `SOURCE_finalized_chapters_1-5.txt`)

**Chapters 3-6:** REORGANIZED (NEW drafts in this directory)
- Chapter 3: Refuge (solo Aunt Mae, ages 5-7)
- Chapter 4: Dave Arrives (FULL arrival story, age 7) ← **THE KEY CHANGE**
- Chapter 5: Shared Refuge (both boys, Dad's bowling, Boys Town, ages 7-8)
- Chapter 6: Two Different Boys (different standards, refuge lost, ages 9-13)

**Chapters 7-8:** RENUMBERED (from finalized chapters 4-5, extracted from `SOURCE_finalized_chapters_1-5.txt`)
- Chapter 7: The Education of Performance (ages 11-14)
- Chapter 8: Strategic Excellence (ages 14-18)

## Files in This Directory

### New Draft Chapters (Ready for Review):
- `chapter_03_Refuge.txt` - Solo Aunt Mae visits only
- `chapter_04_Dave_Arrives.txt` - Full arrival story + first Aunt Mae visit together
- `chapter_05_Shared_Refuge.txt` - Both boys, Dad's bowling, Boys Town
- `chapter_06_Two_Different_Boys.txt` - Different standards + "Refuge Lost" section

### Source Files (For Reference):
- `chapter_01_Two_Worlds_Converging.txt` - Extracted from finalized (unchanged)
- `SOURCE_finalized_chapters_1-5.txt` - Complete finalized version
  - Contains Chapters 1, 2, 7, 8 (which don't change in reorganization)

## Why This Reorganization?

**Problem:** Dave's arrival was compressed to 2 sentences in finalized Chapter 3

**Solution:** Give Dave's arrival a full dedicated chapter (Chapter 4)

**Benefits:**
- ✓ Dave's arrival gets the emotional weight it deserves
- ✓ Chronologically clear (no Dave appearing before "arriving")
- ✓ Each major event properly weighted
- ✓ Refuge arc builds logically: establish → share → lose

## Key New Content

1. **Chapter 4 ending:** First Aunt Mae visit together with "all six hands on the crank"
2. **Chapter 6 addition:** "Refuge Lost" section explaining when/how Aunt Mae visits stopped
