Chapter 13: Finding My Path

**Fall 1986 - Arrival at Stanford**

The drive from Detroit to Stanford in August 1986 felt like stepping out of one life and into another. Dad rode beside me in Mom's old '78 Bonneville as familiar neighborhoods receded in the rearview mirror. Those streets carried identity, community—things I was leaving without knowing what might replace them.

I arrived with fire in my chest: earn a PhD in two years, just like Professor Robert Tarjan had done under Donald Knuth's guidance. Tarjan's work in graph algorithms was already foundational. Knuth's influence on algorithm analysis was unmatched. I wasn't just pursuing a degree—I wanted to contribute to that legacy. It was Mom's voice I heard in my head: excellence equals worthiness. Be the best, or you're not enough.

But Stanford had its own rhythm. The typical dissertation took seven years. The department was world-class, yet I felt adrift. At Princeton, I'd had a strong Black community. At Stanford, I struggled to find connection.

Weekends brought relief. My friend James introduced me to his circle from Cal, and that group became my lifeline. Pickup basketball, poker nights, Silks nightclub in Emeryville. Small escapes that mattered.

Our game nights were ritual—laughter, takeout, endless conversations about where our lives were heading. Cards and competition that pulled me back to Detroit, where reading people quickly had been second nature.

Still, beneath the camaraderie, deeper loneliness crept in. Academic challenges were only part of the journey. I was rebuilding belonging, one piece at a time.

That fall, Tarjan won the 1986 Turing Award for his work on graph algorithms. The highest recognition in our field. Knowing I'd studied under someone of that caliber made the goal feel real, even if distant.

**Winter 1986 - Knuth's Seminar**

Four months after arriving, I found myself in an intimate research seminar led by Donald Knuth—Tarjan's mentor, Turing Award winner in 1974. Seated at a long table with some of the most brilliant theoretical computer science students of my generation, my dreams of Silicon Valley briefly faded, replaced by immediate concern: keeping up.

This wasn't the collaborative environment I'd read about in Ebony profiles of Black tech pioneers. This was theory at its purest, most unforgiving. My practical instincts, so reliable at Princeton, suddenly felt insufficient.

The problems weren't from textbooks. They were raw, complex, often unsolved. The first time I read an assignment, I barely understood what was being asked. My year under Tarjan had given me confidence with graph algorithms, but this abstract mathematical analysis was unfamiliar territory.

What surprised me: I wasn't alone in feeling lost. As we went around the table, others were equally bewildered. This wasn't a room full of students breezing through elite math—it was smart, capable people learning to navigate the unknown together.

We tackled each problem over two weeks, inching forward. My contributions to the first two assignments were small. I mostly watched, tried not to fall behind.

Then came the third problem: graph algorithms. Familiar ground. I dove in with renewed energy, filled pages with diagrams and half-finished proofs by dawn. Exhausted but exhilarated. I had something real.

Walking to Terman Engineering, I ran into Tomas Feder, my Argentinian classmate. Excited, I shared my approach. As I explained, I saw recognition in his eyes—not awe, but understanding. In seconds, he extended my ideas, skipping steps to arrive at a more elegant solution, solving not just the problem I'd focused on but others I hadn't yet seen.

His ease stunned me. In Detroit, I'd taught myself programming and calculus. At Princeton, I'd held my own. But watching Tomas was like watching a grandmaster play chess while I was still learning how the pieces moved. His brilliance was effortless, almost casual. It shattered the tidy narrative I'd been carrying—the arc from inner-city striver to Ivy League success.

Still, I hadn't failed. These were open problems. The real measure was how we thought about them, how we worked together. When grades came, I received an A+.

Despite that success, I remained unsure of my place in pure theory. I'd shown I could contribute, especially on familiar ground. But my encounter with Tomas revealed something deeper: the difference between competence and genius.

With summer approaching, I started searching for opportunities that might point toward a clearer path.

**Summer 1987 - Silicon Graphics**

After my intense introduction to theoretical computer science, summer 1987 arrived like fresh air, reconnecting me to the world I'd first glimpsed in Ebony profiles. At Silicon Graphics, I found what theory couldn't offer: a place where practical innovation mattered more than academic pedigree.

Doctor Marc Hannah, a fellow Bell Labs scholarship recipient and SGI co-founder, represented everything I'd aspired to become—a Black pioneer turning theoretical insights into real-world impact.

Stepping into SGI's offices, I discovered a culture celebrating creativity and collaboration over abstract theory. The energy was infectious: 600 employees jammed into spaces built for far fewer, generating constant, enthusiastic innovation. Basketball courts outside, foosball tables in break rooms, Friday beer busts, lavish annual parties with top music headliners. Everything structured to keep talented minds engaged and collaborative rather than isolated and competitive.

My officemate Vince quickly evolved from colleague to mentor, expanding my world beyond technical pursuits. Through him, I discovered excellence encompassed fine dining, impeccable attire, disciplined workouts, meticulously brewed espresso. Vince's guidance helped me see professional growth as holistic, blending cultural sophistication with technical skill. Our late-night coding sessions turned into expansive discussions, bridging worlds from East to West, engineering to culture, refining my Detroit-born sensibilities.

Our team focused on fundamental challenges in computer graphics, transforming complex mathematical surfaces into beautifully rendered visuals. Collaborating with Vince and senior engineers, I quickly found my niche.

My project addressed the "trimmed patch problem" in computer-aided geometric design. Complex curved surfaces in 3D models are represented mathematically as patches, but accurately rendering these surfaces when trimmed—to create car windows or holes in mechanical components—is notoriously difficult. The algorithms I developed offered a novel method for rendering these trimmed surfaces accurately and efficiently.

Seeing our approach work was transformative. It crystallized a vital lesson: genuine innovation arises from combining practical skills with theoretical insights. This wasn't mere academic exploration—automotive industry clients depended on this technology to visualize their designs, transforming my algorithms into vital industry tools.

Eventually, this work became the cornerstone of my dissertation.

Under the mentorship of senior engineers by day and through intensive study by night, I discovered how my programming skills, merged with theoretical understanding, could solve previously intractable problems. Their brilliance extended beyond theory, demonstrating how profound knowledge could address real-world problems—a compelling model of understanding and application coexisting seamlessly.

Yet academic aspirations lingered. Memories of how Mike and I had once outperformed Princeton's brightest, independently rediscovering solutions known only to Professor Tarjan, continued to fuel my scholarly ambitions.

As summer concluded, I returned to Stanford invigorated yet internally conflicted, torn between collaborative, practical industry and rigorous, theoretical academia.

**Fall 1987 - Spring 1988 - The Theory Qualifying Exam Crisis**

Returning from SGI, I quickly faced another crucial test: the theory qualifying exam. As winter quarter approached, the exam dominated every conversation in graduate student offices on Margaret Jacks Hall's fourth floor. Stories from previous years, whispered rumors about difficulty, amplified collective anxiety. This wasn't merely a test of knowledge—it determined who belonged in Stanford's theoretical computer science program.

Unlike my peers who methodically prepared, I had little genuine interest in this level of mathematical detail. I aspired to the elegant intellectual world inhabited by Professor Tarjan, where proofs reflected brilliant insights rather than tedious derivations. Yet, reminiscent of my electrical engineering courses at Princeton, I continuously procrastinated, always vowing to start seriously the next day.

The qualifying exam was grueling—a week-long take-home test allowing unrestricted access to textbooks and papers. Similar to my economics final at Princeton, this moment tested more than knowledge; it assessed my fundamental sense of belonging. Unlike Princeton, where I'd confidently claimed classroom space, Stanford found me shrinking into the background.

The take-home format intensified my struggle. For seven agonizing days, I sat surrounded by stacks of reference materials, confronted by problems that mocked my inability to grasp their elegance. The open-book freedom emphasized my deeper issue—it wasn't about memorization or access, but profound mathematical intuition I feared I lacked. Mathematics, like professional athletics, demanded consistent practice and dedicated training. I had invested in neither, and my shortcomings became painfully evident.

Each evening left me staring at unsolved problems, blank pages mirroring growing panic. My old Detroit instinct surfaced: never show weakness. Yet Stanford was not Detroit or Princeton, and my usual defenses failed miserably.

When Professor Knuth eventually published the exam solutions, they were concise, masterful proofs composed by students, primarily by Tomas Feder. His solutions, crafted effortlessly during my week of struggle, displayed clarity and sophistication I found unattainable.

The results delivered a crushing blow: I had failed.

The truth I'd tried to avoid shattered my carefully built defenses: passion for elegant algorithms wasn't sufficient. Theory required mathematical maturity I'd forfeited by abandoning advanced math at Princeton to prioritize practical programming. That seemingly reasonable decision now haunted me.

My academic disappointment bled into every facet of life. Calls home dwindled as I dreaded explaining failure to parents accustomed to my success. Pride and shame trapped me in isolation.

The fourth floor of Margaret Jacks Hall transformed into a gauntlet of anxiety. Its dingy graduate student offices, worn carpets, oppressive fluorescent lights seemed suffocating. Navigating these halls meant carefully timing visits, yet sudden encounters were inevitable. Colleagues quickly averted gazes, sharing my discomfort. My failure hung silently in the stale air between us.

Each day deepened isolation, making the already dreary fourth floor darker and more confining. The maze-like corridors, previously a shared academic home, became oppressive and intimidating. My failure had seeped into the physical space itself, embedded in each scuffed carpet tile and flickering fluorescent bulb.

While academic theory left me isolated and inadequate, I began contemplating whether another path might better align with my strengths.

**April 1, 1988 - The Meeting**

When BellCore offered a summer placement back East, I eagerly accepted—not just for professional growth, but to reconnect with my Princeton network. This included a former girlfriend from Fort Lauderdale who'd moved to New York after graduation. Her suggestion to meet one April night in midtown Manhattan felt like an opportunity for closure, or perhaps something more.

By 10:30 PM, my second Long Island Iced Tea was gone. She wasn't coming. The bartender's sympathetic glance—that universal look reserved for the stood-up—said everything as I signaled for another drink.

April 1st. The calendar mocked me.

Three drinks in two hours was too much, so I cancelled my request, paid my check, and headed out. Embarrassed and frustrated, I headed to the Village Gate in Greenwich Village to join Patrick and other Princeton friends.

I spotted Vietta Johnson from Princeton, now a Harvard-trained orthopedist, standing at the bar beside a striking woman with commanding posture, long brown hair shimmering under the club lights.

Drawing on years of sister-cousin coaching, I crossed the dance floor. I fought to maintain eye contact and not glance down at that leather mini again. Her eyes locked onto mine with a slight, warm, welcoming smile. Up close, she was even more captivating, her intelligent eyes immediately sizing me up.

"Gina," Vietta introduced, "this is Derrick, a Princeton classmate. Derrick, meet Gina, a fellow resident at St. Vincent's."

"Resident?" I extended my hand. Her grip was firm, confident.

"Medical resident," she smiled slightly. "Third-year internal medicine."

As Vietta introduced us, something shifted in the atmosphere—an instant recognition transcending the club's superficial environment. When Gina's eyes met mine, I felt simultaneously exposed and welcomed, as if she could see past my carefully constructed personas to something more authentic beneath. The sensation was both terrifying and exhilarating, like stepping onto solid ground after months at sea.

We talked as we danced, voices competing with music, her sophisticated perfume lingering in my senses. Hours dissolved into minutes.

As closing time approached, I asked the question I'd forced myself to hold back until it was welcome.

"What is your phone number?" I asked with the confidence of a male lion.

She raised an eyebrow playfully. "Want to write it down?"

"No need. I got it."

My bravado masked frantic mental repetition: 212-515-0472, 212-515-0472.

Her skeptical expression told me she didn't expect I'd remember.

Neither of us knew this chance encounter, sparked by a stood-up date, would reshape our lives.

**Spring - Summer 1988 - Courtship**

Six weeks after our first meeting, I clutched my BellCore summer offer letter with mixed emotions. My salary hinged on passing qualifying exams I hadn't yet taken. But an exception had been made, giving me just enough breathing room for what mattered most: pursuing Gina.

Our first date almost ended before it began. I paced anxiously in Saint Vincent's Hospital lobby, checking my watch repeatedly. Forty-five minutes late.

Just as I prepared to leave, Gina strode in, smiling and joyful.

"I just got your page," she said happily. "Have you been waiting long?"

"I have been here for 45 minutes," I blurted, barely hiding my contempt.

"Let's go to a local spot," she led.

As I followed her out, the unfamiliar neighborhood streets compounded my lingering anxiety.

After fifty steps, Gina broke the awkward silence. "So, what exactly do you do at Stanford? Computer engineering?"

"Computer science," I corrected, defensively adding, "I think for a living."

She raised an eyebrow and turned toward Manhattan's passing lights, unimpressed.

Great start, Derrick, I chided myself.

Yet something softened between us as we walked after dinner, the city lights illuminating our conversation.

"Are you familiar with New York? I grew up near City College," she said, gesturing north. "I live with my father in our co-op near 141st Street."

"Harlem?"

"Yes, Harlem," she said firmly. "Before gentrification became trendy, before Columbia swallowed everything around it."

"And you went to...?"

"Fieldston, then Yale, then Howard for medical school." She listed her credentials matter-of-factly.

Her connection to Howard resonated powerfully, highlighting my Stanford isolation, echoing my yearning for community. Her world felt both larger and more grounded than mine—intimidating yet irresistible.

My Princeton network stretched across the East Coast like an invisible safety net. These weren't just casual acquaintances but links in a carefully cultivated chain of Black excellence, graduates who had emerged from elite education with their identities intact. When Vietta introduced me to Gina, she wasn't just connecting two individuals but potentially extending this precious network.

On our second date at Melvin's apartment in Morristown, New Jersey, I prepared an ambitious chicken Alfredo while we watched a rented VHS.

As Gina shared the realities of her thirty-hour hospital shifts and life-or-death decisions, my own professional challenges at Stanford acquired new perspective. My theoretical computer science struggles suddenly seemed contained in a protected bubble, far removed from the raw human suffering Gina encountered daily. Yet I recognized a surprising parallel: we were both fundamentally problem-solvers, though in vastly different domains.

Despite the gravity of our conversation, or perhaps because of it, I decided it was time for a strategic move. Heart racing with anticipation, I suddenly sprinted upstairs, returning moments later in a carefully selected tank top and matching shorts, not so subtly highlighting months of hard-earned muscle. Throwing in a casual flex, I basked briefly in my moment, though her reaction was harder to read than I'd hoped.

At 1 AM, when Gina announced she was ready to head home, another assumption shattered. The fifty-mile drive to Manhattan, followed by the lonely fifty-mile return to New Jersey, gave me ample time to reflect.

On our third date, Gina's pager went off twice during dinner. She excused herself each time, returning with weary resignation I would come to recognize as part of her professional armor.

"It's one of my patients," she said softly after the second interruption. "Thirty-two-year-old with PCP pneumonia. Fourth hospitalization this year."

Gina's casual mention of "PCP pneumonia" told me everything about the medical world she inhabited in 1988. Her 32-year-old patient was almost certainly dying of AIDS, a disease medicine was still struggling to comprehend. When she returned to the table, the weariness in her eyes spoke of medicine's limitations in the face of this epidemic. While I wrote code in comfortable labs, Gina worked on the frontlines of a crisis that disproportionately affected marginalized communities.

Gina possessed a centered calm that both attracted and perplexed me. While I had spent my life shape-shifting to fit different environments, she moved through the world with consistent core identity. Watching her switch effortlessly between technical medical terminology and compassionate inquiries about family members, I recognized this wasn't compartmentalization as I'd practiced it—this was integration, a wholeness I was still learning to achieve.

Two weeks later, Gina and I were curled up together on her living room couch, eyes fixed on the TV screen. Jesse Jackson had captured an astounding 29.7% of the Democratic nomination vote—a seismic shift in American political possibilities. His Rainbow Coalition had built bridges across racial and economic divides, challenging conventional wisdom about what kind of leadership Americans would accept.

For Black professionals like Gina and me, watching from her living room in 1988, Jackson's campaign wasn't just politics—it was personal validation. Here was a man who refused to code-switch or dilute his Blackness to appeal to white voters. In a nation still grappling with Reagan-era policies that had devastated many Black communities, Jackson's prominence offered a powerful counter-narrative about Black leadership and possibility.

I glanced at Gina, recognizing my own complicated emotions mirrored in her eyes. Here we were, two Black professionals navigating elite spaces, witnessing something extraordinary unfold. The scale of what Jackson had achieved—taking his rightful place on the national stage, unapologetically Black—resonated strongly with our own journeys through predominantly white institutions where we constantly negotiated our identities.

Over our first weeks together, I'd noticed something wonderfully authentic in Gina's friendships: genuine warmth, deep trust, meaningful connections I'd always valued.

When she called that Friday, casually mentioning, "My brother Hugh is organizing a sailing trip in the Caribbean to celebrate the end of my residency," I listened carefully for what wasn't being said.

"I don't know if there's room," she added lightly, "but if there is... would you like to come?"

This wasn't just a vacation invitation—it was an offer to step into the inner circle of her life, to meet the people who knew her longest and loved her most. For someone who had spent a lifetime trying to prove I belonged, this invitation represented something precious and precarious.

The hesitation in her voice wasn't about physical space—it was about inviting me deeper into her world, into friendships built on honesty and permanence. This wasn't a casual offer; it was a quiet test, an invitation into her future.

When I shared my dilemma with Mom—I'd already committed to Miche's brother's wedding—her response was swift: "Weddings are a dime a dozen. Go sailing in the Caribbean!"

Mom's immediate counsel revealed something essential about her character that I was only beginning to fully appreciate. Beneath her strict rules and high expectations had always run a pragmatic understanding of human connection. She recognized that genuine bonds of love and friendship were ultimately more precious than any achievement.

She was right. Weddings were common enough, but a chance like this—an invitation into Gina's carefully nurtured circle—felt rare and significant.

I stood on the deck of the sailboat, watching turquoise waves lap gently against the hull. The sleek Sou'wester 51 CC was our home for the week. Hugh, Gina's older brother and a successful attorney, and his wife RuthAnne had quickly put me at ease with their humor, reminiscent of the playful teasing between my mother and Uncle Bubba.

Hugh embodied a different kind of male excellence than I'd encountered in academia or Silicon Valley. His confidence wasn't wrapped in credentials or technical jargon but in easy authenticity and clear sense of purpose. In him, I glimpsed what brotherhood could look like when untangled from the complexities of adoption and difference that had shaped my relationship with Dave.

Still, beneath my laughter, I felt the pressure of approval—eager to impress, yet wary of stumbling. My heart quickened when Hugh casually mentioned swimming to shore. From the deck, that beach appeared close enough, maybe 200 yards, tops. Confident after seeing Hugh's swimming skills earlier, I decided to slip quietly into the water, leaving Jay's recommended life vest behind.

The initial swim felt manageable, but upon reaching shore and turning back, the boat suddenly looked shockingly distant. I scanned the water for Hugh, only then realizing he hadn't followed. He had probably joked about swimming to shore and gone below deck with everyone else.

The return swim turned treacherous. Each stroke became increasingly difficult as fatigue set in. By the time I hauled myself up onto the deck, my arms and shoulders were burning intensely, my breathing ragged. Our party below remained completely oblivious to my absence.

As I struggled through that return swim, I confronted a metaphor for my larger life journey. I had always been swimming between worlds—between my biological heritage and my adoptive family, between Detroit's streets and elite academic institutions, between theory and practice. The difference now was that Gina and her circle represented a potential shore, a place where I might finally stop swimming and simply belong.

Later that evening, when I casually mentioned my adventure to Hugh, his expression shifted from surprise to what seemed like newfound respect. "Man, that's a serious swim," he said, clapping my shoulder. "Next time, tell someone before you go."

His concern, wrapped in casual brotherhood, felt like acceptance.

**Fall 1988 - FOCS Conference Epiphany**

The personal toll of my academic struggle had become undeniable. One Sunday morning, as I shaved, I barely recognized the exhausted, drawn face staring back at me. My mother's gentle inquiry during our weekly call—"Are you doing okay?"—held quiet concern I couldn't simply brush off.

Something had to change, not just for my academic future, but for my overall well-being.

Despite failing my theory qualifying exam, I wasn't ready to entirely abandon theoretical ambitions. At SGI, my meticulously maintained collection of recent Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) and Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) proceedings remained my pride and joy. These publications symbolized my aspiration: to write papers that earned me a respected place within these prestigious conferences. When Bellcore funded my trip to FOCS in Chicago, I packed the latest proceedings like a talisman, reminiscent of how I'd prepared books for my first day at Detroit's most prestigious high school years earlier.

Upon arrival in Chicago, I registered eagerly and immediately acquired the new conference proceedings, full of anticipation. However, the reality of the conference quickly shattered my expectations of collegiality and acceptance. As I navigated through the halls, clutching the latest proceedings like a protective shield, I again encountered the invisible barriers that had long marked my academic journey. Attendees clustered in tight-knit groups, exchanging insider references and jokes. My attempts at conversation were met with polite yet distant silence. Once again, I found myself an outsider looking in.

Yet this rejection felt distinctly different. During breaks, while sitting alone and pretending to study the proceedings, I experienced a moment of profound clarity. Although familiar pain lingered, I suddenly understood something essential: I had convinced myself that I wanted to become a theoretician without fully comprehending the cultural realities of academia. Observing the conference closely, it became clear: if this was what academic success meant, it wasn't for me.

This realization was unexpectedly liberating. The problem wasn't a lack of capability; rather, I'd been measuring myself against standards that didn't align with my true strengths or values. Walking back to my hotel that evening, I felt lighter, freed from the weight of expectations that didn't reflect who I genuinely was or wished to become.

Chicago's streets seemed brighter, the evening air fresher. For months, I'd carried the heavy burden of perceived failure. Now, I recognized that what I'd failed at wasn't necessarily what I was meant to succeed in. While theoretical computer science had undeniable value, my true talent lay in bridging theory and practical application, as I'd experienced at Silicon Graphics.

This wasn't giving up; it was discovering my authentic direction.

**Winter 1988 - Summer 1989 - Pivot to Systems**

Armed with newfound clarity from the FOCS Conference, I began exploring systems with determination previously reserved for theoretical computer science. I found myself at Stanford's engineering library at 11 PM, surrounded by stacks of systems papers. The building was nearly deserted, save for a handful of dedicated graduate students hunched quietly over their desks. My lamp cast a focused circle of light onto Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson's original Unix papers as I scribbled notes in the margins.

I traced the evolution of operating systems, from MIT's CTSS through Multics to Unix, observing how each generation refined the lessons of its predecessors. The elegant simplicity of Unix's "everything is a file" philosophy transported me back to my first summer at Bell Labs in Naperville, where I had marveled at the powerful combinations achievable through a few simple commands. I vividly recalled learning to chain grep, sort, and awk through careful study of examples in Unix's manual pages, transforming data effortlessly—tasks that would have taken me days manually.

"It's the same elegance," I murmured to myself, realizing for the first time how deeply Unix's principles had unconsciously shaped my programming style. Initially, I'd appreciated Unix purely for its practicality; now, I began to see and admire its underlying architectural beauty.

In stark contrast to my earlier procrastination with theoretical concepts, I approached systems with genuine enthusiasm and eagerness. I compiled a detailed reading list and methodically immersed myself, often staying up late into the night, unable to consume the papers quickly enough. Each paper built logically upon the last, shaping a coherent mental model of how large-scale computing systems functioned.

The difference was transformative. Theory papers had frequently left me feeling bewildered and discouraged, whereas these systems papers resonated deeply with my practical experiences. Discussions about operating system architectures brought back memories of the layered design in Xinu, reminding me vividly of the challenges of running it on real hardware. Process scheduling discussions triggered recollections of writing assembly language for the 68000 processor. Trade-offs in programming language design evoked memories of the compilers—programs that translate human-readable code into machine instructions—I'd built during my time at Princeton. These weren't mere abstract theories; they were concrete solutions to challenges I'd personally encountered.

I studied alone, without study groups or practice sessions. I didn't know anyone else preparing for the systems exam simultaneously, yet unlike my isolated struggle with the theory exam, I felt no fear or loneliness. This was my comfort zone, where each concept connected naturally to hands-on knowledge I already possessed.

On the day of the exam, I entered the room with newfound confidence absent during my theory exam. When I read the first question about file system design trade-offs, it wasn't an intimidating abstraction—it felt like engaging in a meaningful conversation about real engineering decisions I understood intimately. Comparing Unix's i-node structure with alternative approaches, I found myself writing enthusiastically, driven by genuine excitement rather than academic obligation.

**Summer 1989 - Integrated Identity**

Passing the systems exam provided tangible sense of achievement and validation. The results arrived quietly in my department mailbox, a simple sheet with check marks indicating success across every section. Standing in the hallway of Margaret Jacks Hall, the same place where I had grappled with imposter syndrome just months earlier, I now held tangible proof that I belonged—at least in the systems world.

Yet the path forward remained uncertain. My theory advisor had been denied tenure, and because I'd immersed myself so deeply in theoretical computer science, I had neglected to build relationships with any of the systems faculty. I'd been so focused on fitting into the theory community that I'd overlooked connections with professors whose interests aligned more closely with my own strengths.

But what initially seemed an obstacle quickly became a catalyst. Through my work at SGI, I'd cultivated a professional network and discovered a colleague who was also an assistant professor at Stanford. As I weighed my options, a simple yet powerful possibility took shape: could my practical work at SGI become the foundation of my systems dissertation?

I approached him with this idea clearly outlined: my algorithms were fully implemented, already used by real customers, and with my full fellowship, I required no financial support.

He readily agreed to become my advisor.

Could it really be that simple? The irony wasn't lost on me. After years of struggling to conform to academic expectations within theoretical computer science, my path forward emerged not through academic channels, but industry connections. The same practical work I'd initially pursued as an escape from academic pressures was now the key to academic advancement—on terms that highlighted my strengths rather than my shortcomings.

My academic pivot from theory to systems found unexpected echoes in my evolving relationship with Gina. Just as I'd discovered that my true contribution lay not in pure theory but in bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementation, I was learning that real intimacy required bridging the gap between idealized romance and practical partnership. Both transitions demanded authenticity over performance, substance over appearance.

Back in New York, reality quickly overshadowed our Caribbean afterglow. One evening, as Gina entered the front door of her co-op apartment building on Convent Avenue, a thief snatched the gold chain from her neck. The incident unsettled her far beyond the loss of jewelry. For a woman who'd confidently navigated New York streets all her life, this violation fractured something fundamental in her relationship with the city.

"When are you coming to California?" I asked over the phone, only half-joking.

Gina and I had casually discussed her moving to California, but I'd never taken it seriously. New Yorkers don't leave New York, especially not Harlem-raised, Yale-educated doctors whose East Coast roots stretch back generations.

Yet after the mugging, subtle shifts became noticeable. She didn't break down or blame the city outright; that wasn't her style. In the following weeks, our conversations about the future changed. She stopped automatically dismissing California, instead asking thoughtful questions about neighborhoods, hospitals, and lifestyle. I could sense the careful calculation happening behind her eyes, the measured assessment of a physician reevaluating her prognosis.

Then one Tuesday night, she called and said simply, "I'm looking at positions in Northern California."

No dramatic announcement, no emotional declaration—just quiet certainty. Gina never wavered once her mind was set.

When Gina announced she was looking at positions in Northern California, I felt dizzying mixture of elation and terror. Her words represented a profound act of faith—not just in our relationship, but in me. This brilliant woman with deep East Coast roots was willing to uproot her life based on a connection we'd built over just months.

Was I worthy of such faith?

The answer emerged unexpectedly. When Gina mentioned practicing medicine in California, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic initially seemed perfect, until suddenly, inexplicably, the offer was rescinded. But Gina, driven by the same resolve that had carried her through medical residency, secured a position at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco instead.

With the decision now firm and the employment path clear, we transformed a bi-coastal dating relationship into a budding new future together.

Reflecting on my journey, I saw that moving from theory to systems mirrored my broader transition from Detroit to Silicon Valley, and now from solitary struggle to partnership with Gina. Each shift demanded adaptation; each new phase required growth. Most importantly, each challenge had clarified where my particular talents could make the greatest impact.

I thought back to the Black pioneers I'd admired in Ebony magazine—Marc Hannah, Roy Clay, Ken Coleman. They had carved out their own paths, often outside traditional academic frameworks. True success, I realized, wasn't about meeting someone else's definition of excellence, but about finding a path where my authentic self could thrive.

As the summer of 1989 approached, clarity about my professional and personal identity finally emerged. I wasn't destined to be another Robert Tarjan; my path was uniquely mine, integrating theoretical insights with practical innovation. And I wasn't meant to navigate that path alone—Gina was choosing to walk it with me.

This realization brought not disappointment but relief. I stopped striving to be something I wasn't and embraced who I truly was: someone capable of bridging theory and practice, making theory practical and practice principled. Someone capable of building a life with a woman who embodied the integration I was still learning.

Standing on Stanford's Quad, a profound sense of peace settled over me. The campus that once represented a theoretical ideal was now just one milestone in my evolving journey toward meaningful contribution—both professionally and personally.

The failure I'd once feared had ultimately catalyzed a more genuine, lasting success.

**April 28, 1990 - Chosen Family**

The wedding photos show chosen family assembled: groomsmen Patrick, James Raby, James Latham, Hugh, Dave, Vince. Bridesmaids Brenda, Cheryl, Dayna, June Cross, Wendy. Mom and Dad in the front row, beaming.

Gina's dress. My tuxedo. Two families becoming one.

Dave was there, part of the family circle, though we didn't yet know he was beginning his journey to becoming Jala.

I stood at the altar, looking at Gina, then out at the assembled faces. This was my chosen family—friends from Princeton, colleagues from SGI, family from Detroit, Gina's circle from New York. People who knew different versions of me, now gathered to witness us building something new together.

At SGI, I belonged without explanation. No performance required, no "What are you?" questions to navigate. Just my mind, my code, my contributions.

Marc Hannah had co-founded this 3D graphics powerhouse. We shared the Bell Labs scholarship, Stanford, being Black men from the Midwest. He'd gotten me the summer job that led here. Walking past offices filled with his revolutionary graphics machines, I felt connected to something larger than myself. Here was a model of what was possible—not just technical excellence, but building something that mattered.

Professional belonging felt complete.

And now, standing at this altar, personal belonging was taking shape too. Building my own family with Gina. Creating the life we would share.

But even in this moment of joy, even surrounded by chosen family, I carried questions I couldn't yet answer.

Just weeks before this wedding, that probate court letter had arrived, describing a 6'2" Black lawyer who'd graduated from an Ivy League school. A Jewish woman. Two people who'd somehow found each other in 1963 Detroit.

In seven months, we would have a baby. And I still carried questions about the families I'd never known—questions that Maya's birth would make impossible to ignore.

Looking at Gina, I saw my future. But I still didn't know where I'd come from. Who the 6'2" Black lawyer was. Who the Jewish woman was. Why they'd let me go.

The questions that had followed me my whole life—What are you? Where do you come from?—weren't going away just because I'd built a good life.

If anything, building this family made them more urgent.
