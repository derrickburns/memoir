Chapter 6: Two Different Boys

I could feel her breath as she looked over my shoulder. Mom had walked up behind us as we copied the letters onto huge green paper with sets of three parallel lines, the middle one dotted.

"No, Dave. Loop the lower case 'l'. Do it again. Write five more on the next lines!"

Two years after Dave came to live with us, Mom was beginning to understand something that would reshape our entire family dynamic: Dave was not going to be another Derrick.

At first, she'd approached him with the same strategies that had worked so well with me - structured learning, high expectations, academic focus. But where I had flourished under pressure, Dave seemed to wilt. Where I craved her approval through achievement, Dave sought acceptance through connection.

**The Contrast**

Having Dave as a permanent fixture in my life was different from our playdates. Within weeks, the differences between us became impossible to ignore.

I excelled at schoolwork the way plants thrive on sunlight. Homework was a puzzle to solve, tests were competitions to win, and Mom's academic expectations felt like challenges I was born to meet.

Dave's talents lay in the mysterious art of making friends. He could walk into a room full of strangers and leave with three new best friends. Where I saw potential rejection, he saw potential adventure. Where I calculated risks, he simply jumped in.

Mom noticed everything.

As we grew older, she assigned us household chores: making our beds, dusting the furniture, sweeping the floor, and washing the dishes.

"Derrick! These dishes are greasy!" Mom's words would pierce the kitchen air. "How can you clean with dirty, cold dishwater? Empty it and start again!"

I'd scrub harder, determined to get it right.

But it was Dave's inattention and struggles with her tutoring that really set her off. My good grades would bring a smile to her face, like sunshine breaking through clouds.

"Dave, focus!" she'd say, her teacher-voice sharp with disappointment when he stared out the window during our kitchen table sessions.

While she never explicitly compared us, we both could hear the unspoken question hanging in the air: "Why can't you be like Derrick?"

Those moments made my stomach twist into knots. I wanted to speak up, to tell her how Dave could make anyone laugh, how he could turn strangers into friends with just a smile. But the words stayed locked behind my teeth, held there by fear of losing her approval myself.

Dad had his bowling league—his escape from the intensity that filled our house. I'd seen him there once, relaxed and laughing with his friends, a different version of himself. Mom's control extended everywhere, even trying to reach into those spaces where Dad went to breathe. We all needed refuge somewhere.

**Different Standards**

In the weeks that followed, the household dynamics shifted subtly. Mom's expectations for me remained sky-high, but with Dave, she seemed to oscillate between patience and frustration.

"Dave, how many times do I have to tell you to put your dirty clothes down the chute?" she'd say, her voice carrying that teacher-tone that made both of us freeze.

"Sorry, Mom," Dave would reply, genuinely apologetic but somehow destined to forget again the next day.

Meanwhile, if I left so much as a sock on the floor, Mom's disappointment was swift and sharp.

"Derrick, you know better than this."

I did know better. That was the problem. With knowledge came responsibility, and with responsibility came the weight of constant expectations.

**Summer Activities**

Maybe it was this constant measuring of our different abilities against her unchanging standards that drove Mom to structure our summer so completely. As if enough organized activities could somehow even us out, make us both easier to manage. Whatever her reasoning, Mom filled our days with scheduled events - Vacation Bible School, swimming lessons, Boy Scouts, educational field trips to the zoo and Michigan State Fair.

At the YMCA on Woodward Avenue, we learned proper swimming strokes: freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke. The pungent smell of chlorine turned our eyes red and made our noses burn, but Dave took to the water like he'd been born for it.

I struggled with the rat races across the short side of the pool - dive in, swim across, climb out, wait for the whistle, repeat until your lungs felt ready to burst. While I calculated each stroke and worried about technique, Dave simply enjoyed the water, laughing even when he came in last.

"Good job, boys!" the instructor would call, but I could see Dave's natural athleticism emerging while I remained awkwardly cerebral about everything, even swimming.

**Refuge Lost**

Those weekend visits to Aunt Mae's stopped by the time I turned ten. I don't remember the conversation, if there even was one. I just remember the weekends suddenly being different - no Friday night packing, no Saturday bacon smell, no Sunday Corinthian choir.

Maybe Mom felt we were old enough not to need it anymore. Maybe the logistics became too complicated with both of us. Maybe something shifted between Mom and Aunt Mae that I was too young to understand.

All I know is that the refuge disappeared.

No more hands covering ours on the ice cream crank. No more "What do you want to do today, Shug?" No more Snuffy in the backyard or Uncle John's warm "Hey Boys!" from the porch. No more unconditional acceptance, no more place where mistakes didn't matter.

The loss settled over Dave and me like a fog. We didn't talk about it - we were just boys, and boys don't always have words for grief. But I could feel it in the way our house seemed smaller, more intense, with nowhere to escape Mom's expectations and corrections.

Dave took it harder than I did, though he never said so. I'd catch him staring out the window sometimes, that same careful expression he'd worn when I asked about Mrs. Williams. Another door closed. Another place he couldn't go back to.

We still had each other. Still pushed our beds together at night, still whispered in the darkness, still faced Mom's different standards and Dad's quiet escapes together. But without Aunt Mae's house as counterbalance, home felt heavier. The conditional love more obvious. The need to perform more urgent.

At ten, I was old enough to understand what we'd lost, but too young to know how to grieve it. So I did what I always did: I worked harder, got better grades, tried to be perfect enough that maybe the loss wouldn't matter.

Dave did what he always did: he made friends, laughed easily, sought connection wherever he could find it.

And both of us carried the memory of Aunt Mae's hands covering ours, the feeling of being loved without conditions, the taste of vanilla ice cream made together.

"We did it together," her voice echoed in memory. But now we had to do it alone.

**The Threat**

By the time I turned twelve, something had shifted in our house. The final straw came on a Tuesday evening when I was on the phone with a friend from school, discussing a project we were working on together.

"Derrick! Get off that phone right now!" Mom's words erupted across the room. "You've been talking for twenty minutes!"

"But Mom, we're working on—"

"I don't care what you're working on. Hang up. Now."

I mumbled an apology to my friend and hung up, my face burning with embarrassment. But what really got to me was what happened next. Dave had forgotten to take out the trash again, and Mom's reaction was explosive.

"Dave! How many times do I have to tell you? You're so irresponsible! When are you going to start paying attention?"

Watching Dave's shoulders slump, seeing him shrink under her words while she'd just humiliated me in front of my friend for trying to do schoolwork - something clicked inside me. I was tired of her yelling, tired of her telling me to get off the phone, tired of her judging Dave! Enough was enough. I may not be able to shut her up, but I could shut me up.

So I stopped talking to her.

Not completely - I wasn't stupid enough to ignore direct questions or refuse to answer when spoken to. But I gave her nothing more than she demanded. One-word answers. Shrugs. The minimum required to avoid outright defiance while making my displeasure crystal clear.

"How was school, Derrick?" "Fine." "Did you finish your homework?" "Yes." "Do you want to tell me about your day?" "No."

It was a cold war, and I was determined to win it. I wanted to hurt her the way she hurt Dave with her constant criticism. I wanted her to feel what it was like to be shut out, controlled, dismissed.

After weeks of this treatment, Mom's frustration reached a breaking point. One afternoon, she loaded Dave and me into the car without explanation.

"Where are we going?" I asked, breaking my usual silence.

"You'll see," she said, her voice tight with anger.

We drove through unfamiliar neighborhoods until she pulled up in front of a large home.

We walked inside, and I was struck by the huge circular staircase that led to the second floor. A man came out to introduce himself - he knew we were coming, which meant Mom had planned this.

"What do you do here?" Mom asked, as if she didn't already know. "What is this place?"

"This is a group home for children who have gotten into trouble at home," he explained, his voice matter-of-fact as he looked at Dave and me. "Children whose parents need help managing their behavior."

"This is where children go when they can't behave at home," Mom said, her voice cold and matter-of-fact. "If you two don't start acting right, this is where you'll end up."

Dave's face went pale. I felt my stomach drop, but I refused to let her see my fear.

"Do you understand me?" she demanded.

We both nodded silently.

The drive home was quiet, but the threat hung between us like smoke. Dave's hand found mine in the back seat, both of us understanding that Mom had just shown us exactly how conditional our place in the family really was.

**Finding My Way**

Back home, something had shifted inside me. The group home visit, the weight of being the "difficult" one - it all pressed down like a stone in my chest. I went straight to my room, then slipped out the back door to the park. The familiar sounds of kids playing, the creak of swings, the thud of basketballs - it all felt safer than the quiet tension inside our house.

I hung from the jungle gym, stretching my body, breathing deeply to calm myself.

Then I got on the swings. I used to be afraid of swinging high, afraid that I would fall off. But not today. Today, I wanted to go higher than ever. As I kicked my feet out and back, I felt the old painted wooden seat creak against the metal hooks that attached it to the chains. The wood would not crack. The chains would not break. I would not fall. Not today. Not ever.

I didn't know it yet, but Walter's invitation to U of D High would become my escape route - not just from Mom's expectations, but from the version of myself that everyone at home thought they knew.
