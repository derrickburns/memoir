Chapter 1: Two Worlds Converging

Years later, I would piece together the story of how I came to be—two separate lives converging at Crittenton Hospital in April 1964, creating the mystery that would define my childhood.

My birth mother had lived for months in the maternity home's quiet corridors, where strict rules shielded dozens of young women from the world's judgment. Twenty-two years old, almost finished with her degree, her own divorce not yet final. A Jewish woman pregnant by a Black law student—a scandal that would shake both their communities. In 1964 Detroit, such racial and religious boundaries weren't merely social; they were fiercely maintained lines between worlds. Her parents had arranged her stay, determined to shield their eldest daughter from scrutiny.

Across town, my future mother Willa Burns graded papers at her dining room table, trying to ignore the empty nursery down the hall. Each month brought the same disappointment, the same quiet grief. Her heart lifted briefly during visits to her sister, where children's laughter rang through the house—both a joy and a sharp reminder of what she longed for. Her husband Howard watched helplessly, carrying his own private pain from a son he couldn't reach, couldn't hold, couldn't father.

As spring arrived, my birth mother's time at Crittenton was ending. Through long nights, she had felt me kicking strong and insistent against her ribs, an innocent rebellion against the boundaries already shaping my future.

The phone call came on an April morning. A baby boy, the adoption supervisor told my parents. Mixed race. Beautiful. Healthy. Available immediately. Mom's hand trembled on the receiver, her quiet voice betraying her deepest fear.

"Howard, a mixed child—what if people don't believe I'm his mother?"

Dad met her eyes with quiet resolve. "Willa, you don't select a child like a pair of shoes."

In the hospital, my birth mother held me once, memorizing my face, my scent, the warmth of my small body. Perfect fingers, dark curls, skin lighter than my father's. She named me Michael, though she knew the name wouldn't last. Then she left Crittenton Hospital alone, carrying an ache she would hold for thirty-three years.

For five weeks, I lived between worlds—neither with my birth mother nor my adoptive parents, in temporary care while papers were processed. Even in those earliest days, I existed in the spaces between categories, between families, between identities that adults would spend years trying to make fit.

When Mom and Dad finally brought me home, a colleague of my Mom hung a sign that would witness decades of life unfolding:

"Congratulations to Derrick Raynard for getting such wonderful, loving parents!"

I remember staring up at those bright letters in our basement, puzzled by their meaning.

"Mom, what did I do to get congratulated?" I asked one day.

She smiled, wrapping me in a warm hug, explaining again about being "chosen" and "special"—words that somehow left me more confused. If they chose me, where had I been before? Who hadn't chosen me?

The space between "chosen" and "belonging" would become the defining geography of my childhood, where love and uncertainty coexisted, where gratitude and confusion lived side by side.

Four lives had intersected at Crittenton Hospital—a birth mother, a baby, and a married couple, each forever changed. But the true intersection, where identity meets truth and vulnerability meets courage, would take much longer to find.

That journey was just beginning.


================================================================================


Chapter 2: Foundations

The Project began early.

I started kindergarten at five like other children, but that was just the beginning. Summer meant worksheets at the kitchen table while other children played outside. W's that never matched Mom's exacting standards. Cursive battles. "Do it again, to the end of the row." By the time I entered first grade, I was already reading chapter books. By Christmas, Mrs. Blanding wasn't challenging me enough, so Mom intervened. I skipped to second grade mid-year, joining Mrs. Bridget's class where the work finally matched my preparation. Dad left for TACOM at 7 am—Tank Automotive Command in Warren, where he managed payroll with the same precision he brought to his photography. Mom taught Special Education at McDowell Elementary, then came home to tutor me with a directive intensity that left no room for resistance.

The lesson crystallized early: smart meant loved.

I learned to raise my hand before questions were finished. To ace every test. To bring home papers that made Mom smile and say, "Good"—though the unspoken continuation hung in the air: "But you could do better."

Dad documented everything. His camera bag was always ready, lenses cleaned, film loaded. He approached every shot with meticulous care—perfect lighting, perfect angle, perfect moment. Our family albums became visual proof: happy adopted sons in a loving Black family. The perfect shot was both gift and performance requirement.

At kindergarten graduation, Mom pinned the too-long white gown that pooled around my feet "like a miniature wedding dress." Her instructions were clear: "Act right. Smile. Walk straight. Don't talk unless spoken to by an adult." I marched to "Pomp and Circumstance," needing to pee but afraid to ask, while Dad's camera flash captured the moment. Mom's smile afterward was bigger than I'd ever seen it. Other mothers praised her for having a reading child—by the end of kindergarten, I was already ahead.

That night, looking at family photos, I asked about the people in the pictures. There was me as a baby with Mrs. Esther M. Ricks, the adoption supervisor, standing outside a brick building. "She helped us to find you," Mom explained, though I didn't understand what that meant. There was Dad in his wartime photograph—Company A, 1st Battalion, Fort McClellan, Alabama, January 1943. Hundreds of soldiers in formation, all the white soldiers sitting in front, all the Black soldiers standing in back.

I didn't notice the segregation until I was ten. By then, I'd learned that Dad had been a cook and photographer in France during World War II, that the G.I. Bill had paid for his schooling at Detroit School of Photography and Slade-Gragg Academy, that promises "didn't always work the same for everyone." I understood that Dad's darkroom—with its red glow under the door and tick-tick-tick of timer—was his safe place, where he could be present and invisible, like a ghost behind the lens.

The photographs taught me to see what adults carefully didn't say. I looked different from my parents. My skin was lighter. My features were different. The framed pictures walking through our dining room told a story: Mom, Dad, Aunt Mae, me, Aunt Vivian, Sister and Paul. But I wasn't born into these frames—I was placed into them.

**The Loneliest Desk**

The wooden desk in Mrs. Bridget's second-grade classroom felt too big for me, like everything else. Multiplication tables marched across the blackboard in neat white rows. Seven times eight.

My hand shot up before I could stop it, fingers stretching toward the ceiling tiles.

"Ooh, ooh!" The sound escaped my throat like a trapped bird.

Mrs. Bridget's chalk paused mid-stroke. "Yes, Derrick?"

"Fifty-six!" The answer burst out, sweet relief flooding through me like when you finally scratch an itch.

"Very good." Her smile was warm, but behind me came the whispers, sharp as pins.

"Teacher's pet!"
"Show-off!"
"Think you're so smart..."

I slid lower in my seat, trying to fold myself smaller. The wood grain on my desk became fascinating—little rivers and valleys I could trace with my finger. But then Mrs. Bridget's chalk tapped against the board again: "12 x 9."

My arm betrayed me again, shooting up like it had a mind of its own. One hundred and eight screamed in my head, demanding to be let out.

Each correct answer I gave seemed to add another brick to an invisible wall growing between my desk and everyone else's. When the final bell rang, I waited until the scraping of chairs and shuffling of feet faded away. Better that way. No one to "accidentally" bump into me or whisper those names that followed me like shadows.

Outside, the afternoon sun hit me like a spotlight. Kids clustered in noisy groups on the front steps, planning after-school adventures or waiting for older siblings. Glenn caught my eye and waved, but he was already surrounded by his usual crowd, his big brother Dennis standing nearby. At least there was one familiar face from the neighborhood in my new class, even if we only shared quick waves.

I started the walk home, scuffing my shoes against the sidewalk. Each step taking me further from school made my shoulders feel lighter, but home wasn't the safe place it should have been. Instead, it was just a different kind of lonely—quieter, but somehow louder in its silence.

At age four, I sat on the dense dark green carpet in the den, having just emptied out my toy box onto the floor: coloring books, crayons, matchbox cars, playing cards, jacks, and a small rubber ball. Dad had taught me how to play Solitaire. I could play with all these by myself.

And that was the problem.

I had done this before. So many times. Emptying out the toy box, looking for the new game, that new toy. But what I was looking for, I could not find. I did not want to play alone.

Mom was always busy. Dad too.

My friends all had siblings. Sheryll Cunegin had three brothers and a sister. Henry Brown had four brothers. Steven Barnett had two older sisters. Glenn Burch had his big brother Dennis. Lucius Austin had his brother Julius. I had no one.

Sometimes Cille would play gin rummy with me after school, her patient hands arranging the cards. Sometimes, when Dad came home at 4:30 and settled into his favorite chair in the living room with the Detroit Free Press, I'd ask: "Dad, can we play?"

"Let me finish my paper first."

I'd wait, hopeful. But then Mom would call us to dinner, and that was the end of that.

The loneliness built over time. Not one dramatic moment—just the accumulation of empty afternoons, of toy boxes emptied onto green carpet, of wanting someone to play with.

When I came home from school, Cille would pull back the white lace curtain: "Who is it?"

"It's me!"

"Your snack is on the table. And don't forget to take off those shoes—I just mopped that floor!"

She'd head downstairs to resume ironing while I carefully placed my shoes on the newspaper behind the door. The peanut butter and jelly sandwich was always cut diagonally, just the way I liked it, with a glass of milk beading condensation. After finishing, I'd head downstairs to watch Cille press sheets with precise, practiced movements near Dad's bowling trophies, the small kitchen TV playing Doctor Tom Horton on University Hospital.

"How was school?" she'd ask, not looking up.

"Fine."

"Can we play gin rummy later?"

Cille was the only grown-up who never seemed too busy to play cards, even if she did show no mercy when it came to winning.

"After my stories. And after you do your homework. Mrs. Burns would have my hide if you didn't finish your work first."

After my favorite shows ended—Three Stooges, Little Rascals, Land of the Lost, Star Trek—the silence would crash in like a wave. When Dad arrived at 4:30, I'd watch him settle into his chair, the newspaper crackling as he unfolded it like a shield between us.

"Dad, want to play cards?"

"Let me finish the paper first."

But the paper never seemed to end before dinnertime. And Mom needed to cook dinner. I'd retreat to my solitary games—Solitaire, a game whose very name mocked my loneliness, or jacks bouncing against the empty floor, or Hot Wheels cars racing to nowhere.

One Saturday afternoon, the weight of solitude finally crushed through my defenses.

"I'm lonely!" The words burst from me like water through a broken dam. "I want a brother!"

Mom and Dad exchanged one of those long, heavy looks adults share when they're speaking without words. I could see something shifting behind their eyes—Mom's teacher-brain already working on the problem, Dad's quiet consideration weighing options I couldn't imagine.

"We hear you, baby," Mom said. "Let us think about this."

A few weeks later, Mom made an announcement, her voice carrying an unusual note of anticipation: "David is coming to visit tomorrow. He'll be here at 5 PM."

"David Ragland?" I asked, thinking of a boy from Mom's school.

"No, a different David."

The way she said "a different David" felt weighted with meaning she wasn't sharing.

When David arrived at our door, I saw him immediately: smaller than me, with curly black hair and brown eyes as big as quarters. Frumpy clothes that didn't quite fit. But it was his eyes and his soft voice that told me everything I needed to know. I already could size up people, even at four. I thought: he is soft and kind like me.

Mom suggested we go to the basement, laying out the rules: "No roughhousing, no yelling, clean up when you're finished." At first he seemed to shrink under Mom's schoolteacher voice. But then something magical happened. His whole face transformed. His smile lit up like a lamp being switched on, and his laughter made our basement feel warmer somehow.

We built fortresses with my blocks, creating elaborate worlds with moats and bridges and secret passages. We raced Hot Wheels across the vinyl tile floor, thrilled each time they crashed into the wall. We played on the toy white piano, pressing keys and making noise. For the first time in what felt like years, the house didn't echo with emptiness anymore.

When time came for him to leave, he looked back over his shoulder at me, like he didn't want the afternoon to end either.

David's visits became more frequent, and somewhere along the way, he became "Dave." Each time he came over, the basement felt less like my lonely refuge and more like our special place. We'd huddle on the basement floor around the train set Dad had built, the Santa Fe engine puffing tiny clouds of smoke. Dave's eyes would light up.

"Faster?" he'd ask, reaching for the transformer dial.

"Yeah!"

We'd take turns adjusting the speed, lost in the soft hum of the motor, like we were running a real railroad. On the white upright toy piano—a Christmas gift from when I was five—we'd coax melodies from the keys, making up songs that only we understood, filling the basement with music and laughter.

Sometimes I'd ask Dave about where he lived before. His face would change, like when you accidentally step on something sharp and try not to show it hurts.

"Mrs. Williams was okay," he'd say, but the way he said "okay" didn't sound like okay at all. It sounded careful, like walking on ice.

I learned not to ask about her anymore. Even at seven, I could tell some doors were better left closed.

But the best part was simply having someone to talk to, someone who listened to my ideas for games and added his own. Dave had this way of making everything more fun, more interesting, more alive.

Then one day, after Dave had been visiting for weeks, Mom asked me while I was lying down next to her in her bedroom: "Would you like Dave to stay here? To live with us?"

"Yes!" The word burst from me before I could even think, like it had been waiting there all along.

That evening in the basement, I was trying to teach Dave "Chopsticks" on the toy piano when Dad descended the stairs wearing that special smile that made his whole face soft. He crouched down next to Dave and in a gentle voice asked, "Would you like to live here with us?"

Dave's face bloomed with joy. "Yes!" he shouted, and my heart soared with his answer.

The lonely boy who'd begged for a brother was disappearing, replaced by someone new: a big brother.

Just like that, I had a brother.

The first night Dave stayed, Mom put us in our separate twin beds on opposite sides of the room. After she left, we pushed them together. It became our secret—every night Mom would separate them, and every night after she left we'd push them back together.

I was conflicted. I loved having someone to talk to, a hand to hold, someone who could hear me when I said I was afraid or sad. But Dave had feelings too. He needed attention from me, and I did not know how to give it. At times, I grew resentful of having to share my room, sharing my space every day.

I no longer felt alone. But I also no longer had alone time. He was always there, and that was difficult to adjust to.

Everything changed with Dave there. I showed him the neighborhood—Mac's Barber Shop where we both got our haircuts, the corner store, the routes to school. I introduced him to the neighborhood kids: "This is Dave. He's my brother."

Not by blood, but by choice.

Two boys between worlds. Both chosen. Both adopted. Both carrying stories we were too young to understand.

By age ten, the foundations were set. I knew that achievement earned love. I knew that I was chosen, which made me special but also different. I knew that Dave and I were brothers despite having no shared DNA. I knew that Dad's camera captured perfect moments while his war photograph showed him how to stay present but invisible. I knew that Mom's fierce advocacy was both gift—she got me into accelerated programs, pushed schools to challenge me—and burden. The unspoken message was clear: as a Black child in America, especially one who was adopted and mixed-race, I would need to be exceptional to be considered equal.

What felt like choice in those tender years would calcify into compulsion. Smart didn't just mean loved—it meant worthy of having been chosen at all.

The grammar of conditional love was becoming my native language.

Chapter 3: Refuge

But weekends were different.

"Shug!" Aunt Mae's voice rang out as the screen door creaked open, her arms already spreading wide. She smelled like vanilla and fabric softener, her hug enveloping me completely. Aunt Mae was tall and buxom where Mom was tiny and compact. She was welcoming where Mom was directing. She was unconditional where Mom was expecting.

Friday nights at 18606 Mackay followed warm rituals. We made the bed together in the small back bedroom, Aunt Mae inviting me close when Mom would have shooed me away. She'd wash my face and hands, lifting me onto the wooden stool at the bathroom sink, her movements gentle and unhurried. Then we'd sit in the curve of the couch, me nestled under her arm while she read her Bible in the lamplight. Sometimes she'd read passages aloud, her voice making the words sound like music. Sometimes we just sat in comfortable silence while the evening settled around us.

Saturday mornings meant bacon. The smell would wake me before Aunt Mae appeared in the doorway, already smiling. "Morning, Shug. You hungry?" She'd let me help make breakfast—breaking eggs into the bowl even when shells fell in, which she'd fish out gently without scolding. She'd cut my toast into triangles because that's how I liked it, a small attention that made me feel seen.

After breakfast, I'd play with Snuffy, Aunt Mae's golden collie, in the backyard. Snuffy and I had an understanding: she tolerated my attempts to ride her like horses on TV, and I navigated the obstacle course of her deposits with increasingly skilled precision. Sometimes I'd just lie in the grass next to her, my hand buried in her soft fur, feeling the rise and fall of her breathing.

But the best part of Saturday was making ice cream together.

Aunt Mae would bring out the wooden bucket and the metal canister, setting them on the kitchen counter with ceremony. "Ready to make something sweet, Shug?" I'd nod eagerly, already pulling a chair over to reach. She'd let me crack the eggs (more shells), measure the sugar (spilling some), pour in the vanilla (splashing the counter). None of it mattered. She'd just smile and guide my hands, showing me how to stir the custard until it thickened.

Then came the cranking. We'd layer rock salt and ice around the metal canister, and I'd grasp the wooden handle with both hands, turning it with all my might. At first it was easy, the handle spinning freely. But as the ice cream formed, the resistance grew. My shoulders would start to burn. My hands would ache. I'd slow down, frustrated, ready to quit.

That's when Aunt Mae's hands would cover mine on the crank.

"We're almost there, Shug," she'd say softly. Her larger hands enveloped my smaller ones, her strength supplementing mine without taking over. Together we'd push through the final hard minutes, the crank getting stiffer and stiffer until finally—finally—it wouldn't turn anymore.

"There we go," Aunt Mae would say, triumph and gentleness in equal measure. "We did it."

She never said "I did it" or "You did it." Always "we." As if my small contribution mattered as much as her strength. As if we were partners in creating something sweet.

The ice cream itself was good—rich vanilla flavored with extract. But that's not what I remember most. What I remember is Aunt Mae's hands covering mine. What I remember is being invited to help, to be close, to contribute something that mattered. What I remember is the feeling that even when I wasn't strong enough alone, she would be there to help me finish what we started together.

While we waited for the ice cream to harden, Uncle John would be on the porch, sitting in his chair with his glass of "juice"—orange juice with something added that I knew I should never touch. Men from the neighborhood would stop by to play checkers, and Uncle John would win every game with quiet satisfaction. "Hey Boy!" he'd greet me, his voice warm, and I'd wave back before returning to whatever Aunt Mae had invited me to do next.

"What do you want to do today, Shug?"

That question surprised me every time. At home, Saturdays meant chores and errands that moved around my wants, never with them. Mom would tell me what to do: "Wash these dishes. Make your bed. Sweep the floor. No, like this. Do it again." But Aunt Mae asked what I wanted, as if my desires mattered, as if an entire afternoon could be shaped around them.

Sometimes we'd sit on the couch and she'd tell me stories about when Mom was young. How Aunt Mae had been like a mother to Mom and Aunt Vivian, raising her two younger sisters when their own mother couldn't. How she'd pushed Mom to get her education: "You will get your education so you don't have to wash white people's clothes or take care of white people's babies." How proud she was when Mom became a teacher.

Aunt Mae had no children of her own, but she'd mothered her sisters, and now she grandmothered me with the accumulated love that had nowhere else to go.

Sunday meant Corinthian Baptist Church. Aunt Mae would sing in the choir loft, her voice rising with the others in "Amazing Grace," and I'd sit in the pew feeling something I couldn't name. It wasn't the formal, careful belonging of Primary Church at Metropolitan, where Mom watched to make sure I sat still and acted right. At Corinthian, people claimed me: "Is that Classie's nephew?" "Yes ma'am." "Well, aren't you handsome!" After service, Aunt Mae would buy me a Fanta orange pop, and we'd stand in the fellowship hall while people gathered around her, everyone wanting a piece of her warmth.

Dave started coming to Aunt Mae's after he joined our family. She welcomed him with the same immediate, unconditional acceptance she'd shown me. "Shug!" she'd call to me, then turn to Dave with arms spread equally wide: "And here's my other Shug!"

Watching her with Dave showed me something important. This wasn't about me being special. This was about her way of loving—complete, uncomplicated, unconditional. She didn't love me because I earned good grades or acted right or made her proud. She loved me because I existed. Because I walked through her door. Because I was exactly who she'd been hoping to see, every single time.

Dave and I were different children. I was careful, controlled, driven by The Project to achieve and excel. Dave was easier, more natural with people, quicker to laugh and slower to worry about what adults thought. When we helped Aunt Mae with tasks, I'd concentrate intensely on doing everything perfectly. Dave would chat and joke, making her laugh, not worrying if he spilled or made mistakes.

Aunt Mae loved us both exactly the same.

**Dad's Escape**

At home, the differences between Dave and me created friction in ways that made the house feel smaller. Where I flourished under Mom's pressure, Dave wilted. Where I craved approval through achievement, Dave sought acceptance through connection.

Every Tuesday and Wednesday evening, Dad went bowling. It was his escape, his space apart from Mom's intensity. But one Wednesday night, Mom's frustration boiled over.

"Boys, get in the car."

"Where are we going?" I asked.

"To get your father."

The bowling alley hit us with a wall of sound and smoke. Pins crashing, men laughing, cigarettes burning in ashtrays. I'd never seen Dad like this—relaxed, laughing with his bowling buddies, his whole body language different from the quiet, careful man who read the newspaper in his chair at home.

Mom grabbed Dad's elbow. "Howard, we need to go."

He turned, surprised. "Willa, what are you doing here?"

"It's a school night. The boys have homework."

I could feel eyes on us—Dad's friends watching, curious or uncomfortable. Dave pressed close to my side.

The ride home was silent, tension thick in the air. But when we pulled into the driveway, Dad's voice cut through the quiet with an authority I'd never heard him use with Mom.

"Willa, if you don't want the boys around smoking, drinking, and cursing, don't bring them to the bowling alley."

Mom said nothing. But something had shifted. I'd glimpsed how different my parents could be, how Dad carved out spaces where Mom's control couldn't quite reach, and how fragile those spaces were.

That's what made it confusing. At home, my careful performance earned approval while Dave's ease often earned correction: "Why can't you be like Derrick?" But at Aunt Mae's, there was no performance requirement. No comparison. No need to be anything other than ourselves.

Sunday afternoons meant leaving.

Aunt Mae would pack leftover ice cream and hand it to Mom at the door. She'd hug us: "You be good for your mama now."

Dave and I would climb into the back seat of Mom's Pontiac. As we drove back home, Mom would remind us to do our chores that we had not done.

"Derrick, when you get home, I want you to wash the dishes. Dave, you dry and sweep the floor. Derrick, you need to clean the bathroom. Don't make me have to tell you again. I want this done right tonight."

And so, the happy carefree weekend with Aunt Mae ended in a list of tasks to be done. Mom had no time to play.

Through the window, I'd watch the houses on each side of the block pass by. Some neighbors sat on their porches like Uncle John. We'd quickly get to 7 Mile Road where I'd see the A&P grocery store and the diagonal intersection of Conant and 7 Mile Road. We'd pass Pershing High School and the Dairy Queen. On occasion, Mom would stop there.

Those weekend visits stopped by age ten. I don't remember why.

**Boys Town**

One summer, we took a family road trip toward Los Angeles. Dad had the AAA Triptik mapped out, the TourBook marking potential stops. Dave and I fought over who got the window seat until Mom made us switch every hour.

Mom had planned a detour: Boys Town in Nebraska.

We pulled into the parking lot, and there it was—the bronze statue that appeared on every piece of Boys Town literature. A bigger boy carrying a smaller one on his back, the inscription reading: "He ain't heavy, Mister... he's m' brother!"

Families gathered around, taking photos. A little kid asked his mother, "Why's that boy carrying the other one?"

"Because that's what brothers do," she said. "They help each other."

Dave's face went expressionless—almost like he was asleep except his eyes were wide open. I felt my pulse racing, pressure building in my chest, a lump forming in my throat I couldn't swallow.

Mom's hand rested on Dave's shoulder as the tour guide talked about Father Flanagan, about how Boys Town started as a place for boys who had nowhere else to go. Boys who needed homes.

Boys like Dave?

I couldn't meet Dave's eyes. Questions I couldn't ask hung in the air between us: Did Dave think this was why we stopped here? Was Mom reconsidering? Was she showing us what could still happen if we didn't behave?

The drive away from Boys Town was subdued. The radio seemed muted. Endless cornfields rolled past the windows. Then I felt Dave's hand find mine between us on the back seat—a simple gesture that carried everything we couldn't say aloud.

We never made it to Los Angeles that trip. Dad was too tired, and he wouldn't let Mom drive. Denver became our destination. LA remained a dream for another time. But what I remember most is Dave's hand in mine, and the question neither of us dared to ask: How permanent was our place in this family?

I never felt more loved and more secure than I did in that small two-bedroom home at Aunt Mae's. Not because Mom and Dad didn't love me—they did, fiercely. But their love came with expectations, with conditions, with the weight of The Project and the need to prove I was worth choosing. Aunt Mae's love just was. Simple. Complete. Asking nothing but my presence.

Years later, I would understand what made those weekends so powerful. Aunt Mae showed me what unconditional love felt like. She showed me that I could be wanted exactly as I was, without achievement or performance or careful behavior. She showed me that mistakes didn't matter when hands covered yours on the crank, helping you finish what you started.

But she also created a problem I didn't have words for yet: once you know that kind of love exists, once you've felt what it's like to be accepted without conditions, you spend the rest of your life searching for it again. And you spend the rest of your life feeling the ache of its absence in spaces where love requires you to earn it.

I loved Aunt Mae's house. I loved her hands covering mine. I loved the screen door creak and the vanilla smell and Snuffy and the ice cream and the Sunday choir and being called "Shug." I loved that she asked what I wanted to do. I loved that at her house, I could just be.

But I also loved Mom. I loved that she fought for my education, pushed me to excel, believed I could be exceptional. I loved Dad's quiet presence and his careful photographs. I loved our family, chosen and built with intention.

The confusion lived in loving both, but feeling so different in each space. Was I betraying Mom by preferring Aunt Mae's? Was I ungrateful for wanting this place where mistakes didn't matter? Was there something wrong with me for feeling more at home in a house that wasn't mine than in the one where I slept every night?

I didn't have answers. I just had the ice cream container on my lap, the taste of vanilla still sweet on my tongue, and Aunt Mae's voice echoing in my heart: "We did it, Shug. We did it together."

Those words would carry me through decades of trying to figure out what kind of love I was searching for, and whether I'd ever find hands covering mine again when the cranking got too hard to finish alone.


================================================================================


Chapter 4: The Education of Performance

At eleven, I crossed Seven Mile Road on the bus to Law Middle School, leaving the familiar territory of my neighborhood for the first time. The bus passed Mac's Barber Shop and Mount Elliott Post Office before turning onto Rogge Street, delivering me to a three-story red brick building filled with white kids—not just one or two, but dozens.

For the first time in my life, I did not stand out.

Miss Vigliotti taught math. She was pretty like women on TV, with a nice smile that made my stomach flip. She kept my excellent work in a special folder. When she announced midyear that she was taking leave, it felt like a punch in the stomach—a loss I couldn't explain or admit to anyone.

Doctor James Allen Jones taught differently than any teacher I'd known. He was my first Black male teacher—bald with a beard and rectangular glasses, wearing sports coats and slacks, commanding the classroom the way Doctor Morton commanded Metropolitan's pulpit. When he performed Macbeth's "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" soliloquy, Shakespeare stopped being dead words on a page and became alive, urgent, real.

"What do YOU think, Derrick?" he'd ask, emphasis on YOU. Not "What does the book say?" or "What did we learn?" But what did I think?

It was such a strange question that I didn't know how to answer at first. I'd been taught to know the right answers, to raise my hand first, to demonstrate mastery. I hadn't been taught to have opinions that mattered beyond being correct or incorrect.

Doctor Jones didn't want performance. He wanted thought.

Square dancing brought Kim into my arms. Strawberry blonde hair, blue eyes, cool hands during the do-si-do. For weeks we danced together in class.

I worked up the courage. During square dancing class, with her friends just a few feet away, I asked for her phone number.

"No!"

I froze, speechless. My chest tightened. My stomach clenched. Class was ending. I could see the snickering of her friends. I gathered my things and left immediately, afraid to show my disappointment and shame.

The rest of the day, I withdrew into myself. I focused on my school work. In geography class I drew maps of France and Spain, shifting my head from the image of the countries on the maps posted on the walls and my drawing paper, but never lifting it up to meet anyone else's gaze.

The next time I saw her, I felt the pain of rejection resurface. But I shut it down. I will not let her know that I am pained. I will not allow myself to feel.

Eugene changed things. We met at play tryouts—he was in seventh grade, a year ahead, with a deep voice and easy confidence. Only two Black kids in the play, we gravitated together naturally. After rehearsals, I'd bike a mile to his house on Albany Street, past Sojourner Truth projects, to play chess in his room while funk music played. He beat me in ten moves. Then again. I smiled despite hating to lose, already planning my return.

When I visited Eugene, it was just the two of us, playing chess. With all his shit talk, he was still engaging with ME.

Then came the family trip to England—Doctor Jones taking a select group to perform Coriolanus in hospitals and schools. At the hospital performances, I watched kids in wheelchairs and on crutches, some with IV stands. We were using what we could do to make sick children forget their pain for an hour. That felt important in a way grades never had.

But in England, Eugene was different. "Eugene," I called, and I got back a one-word "Yeah" or "What?" Where was the friend who I would happily ride my bike nearly a mile to see? He was gone, I suppose. Wrapped up with his other friends from school.

I felt invisible. Worse than being picked on, I was unseen.

I was so hurt that I never called him again after England.

---

One day I was running down a twisting pathway with flowers and plants growing into the walkway. I stepped on a bee. The sting hit sharp and hot. I cried from the pain for a few minutes, then it passed.

---

When I went to my bedroom after feeling the shame of rejection at school, I wanted to be alone. But there was Dave. I did not want to share with him my humiliation. After all, I am the big brother, right? It is already bad enough that he has to fight for me. But with girls? How can I acknowledge my shame.

There he is, asking me how I am doing. He is reaching out, and I feel bad not just because I feel embarrassed from the incident, but because I am withdrawing from the one person in this household who loves me unconditionally.

God, I am such a bad person.

---

**The Threat**

At twelve, something had shifted in the house. The tension between Mom's expectations and my growing need for independence created a cold war neither of us knew how to end.

It started small. A phone call with a friend about a school project ran twenty minutes.

"Derrick! Get off that phone right now!"

"Mom, I'm working on—"

"I don't care what you're working on. Hang up. Now."

The humiliation burned. My friend heard everything.

Then Dave forgot to take out the trash, and Mom's explosion shook the house. I watched him shrink, watched her fury, and something inside me hardened. For weeks, I stopped talking to Mom beyond one-word answers: "Fine." "Yes." "No."

One Saturday afternoon, Mom loaded Dave and me into the car without explanation.

"Where are we going?" I asked.

She said nothing.

We drove through neighborhoods I didn't recognize until Mom pulled up in front of a large house with a huge circular staircase visible through the front windows. A man met us at the door, his expression professionally kind in a way that made my stomach tighten.

"This is a group home," he explained, walking us through rooms filled with institutional furniture, "for children who have gotten into trouble at home. Children whose parents need help managing their behavior."

Dave's face went pale. I refused to let Mom see my fear, keeping my expression carefully blank even as my pulse hammered in my ears.

Mom's voice was quiet but firm: "This is where children go when they can't behave at home. If you two don't start acting right, this is where you'll end up."

"Do you understand me?"

We both nodded silently.

The drive home was quiet. Dave stared out the window. I stared at my hands.

Mom had just shown us exactly how conditional our place in the family really was. We weren't sons who could make mistakes and still belong. We were chosen, yes—but we could be unchosen just as easily. The door back to institutionalization stood open, waiting for us to fail.

The message was clear: smart didn't just mean loved. Good behavior didn't just mean approval. They meant the difference between home and homelessness, between family and foster care, between belonging and abandonment.

I never forgot that drive. And I never stopped performing.

---

Mom mentioned Walter Booker loved U of D High School on Seven Mile Road. "The Jesuit Academy starts at seventh grade. You need to take a test to get in."

I took the test. I got in. Law Middle School's memories—Miss Vigliotti's folder, Kim's rejection, Eugene's chess games and abandonment—would stay behind as I crossed into a new world.

---

University of Detroit Jesuit Academy welcomed me at twelve with Mrs. Voss in the Dean's office, handing me my schedule: Reading, Math 7, English 7, Art, Gym, Social Studies, Theology 7. The Mass ceremony felt strange—different hand motions than Metropolitan, priests who couldn't marry (why?), theology classes exploring Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, not just declaring one truth.

Over half my homeroom 7A was Black. White kids came on buses from suburbs. We were the local ones. This felt important somehow.

Mr. Zybrad taught math with eyes that closed when he smiled like a cat. He'd toss chalk at daydreamers: "Mr. Burns!" I learned to stay alert. When two kids bet on the Super Bowl—I tried to bet both sides, thinking it was genius—Mr. Zybrad forced a settlement after the Steelers won and winners wouldn't pay. The other kids looked at me "like I was from another planet." I was learning there were social rules I didn't understand, gaps in my knowledge that had nothing to do with academics.

I got cut from baseball and track. Other kids had Little League experience, CYO leagues I'd never heard of. My name wasn't on either list. The embarrassment burned.

But I found the computer room.

A TTY-33 Teletype terminal sat in a 5x5 foot room, its modem connecting to U of D McNichols. Star Trek (1971) printed on yellow paper at 110 baud—Mike Mayfield's program, line by line. I'd type commands, wait for responses, adjust strategy. In that small room, I didn't have to contend with anyone else's emotions. I had no one to impress or disappoint. No one to judge me, and nothing to fear.

The computer didn't care about my need to prove myself. It responded only to logic, to precision, to getting things right. I relished the solitary nature. Programming became my safe space—predictable, controllable, mine.

Dad drove me to Saturday Mathematics Club meetings at Lawrence Tech. I'd program battleship games on keypunch machines, cream-colored cards coding my logic, never beating the same two Asian-American students but building something more valuable than winning: confidence through technical mastery, persistence despite falling short.

Then Jimmy Latham said something that changed everything: "I was adopted."

"Really?! So was I!"

We weren't alone. I mentioned Crittenton Hospital. Jimmy said he was born there too. Then he told me Ron Levi was also adopted—also from Crittenton.

Three boys. Same small school. Same hospital where our stories started.

Jimmy became Brother Jimmy—not by blood, but by the shared experience of being chosen, of understanding what it meant to be adopted without having to explain it.

---

At fourteen, I was learning to perform. U of D had different groups—Tim Devine with older brothers and a mom who led the Mother's Club, Jerry Cahalan whose dad was Wayne County Prosecutor, Tom Doyle who seemed smart, Chaldeans with noses and hair like mine. I learned to navigate each group differently.

I hated History—dates and memorization felt arbitrary. I loved English—you could argue without interruption. When dominance-seeking boys challenged me, I retreated to intellectual superiority: "What you think doesn't matter because I am intellectually superior." It was a shield, steering conversations to academics and politics where I could regain control.

Jimmy had a different weapon: humor. He stayed in the social arena, making people laugh, never retreating to claims of superiority. When his English teacher gave him a D on an essay I'd helped rewrite—an essay that would have been an A for me—Jimmy's mom complained to the principal. Mr. Baugh was gone the next semester. Jimmy taught me that there were different kinds of power.

With girls, I felt different. Comfortable. "Like floating in salt water on a warm sunny day, relaxed, soothed, completely at ease." But that comfort made me vulnerable. When Tiffany invited me to a movie and we kissed in the theater—wonderful, electric, perfect—I leaned in for another kiss when her friend drove me home.

"No!"

The violence in her voice, her friends witnessing my humiliation, the confusion of the same kiss being welcome in one context and threatening in another. I was learning that context mattered, that social rules I didn't innately understand governed interactions, that reading situations correctly was survival.

Plymouth Church parties brought new questions I'd never been asked: Where do you live? What do your parents do? Which church? Cotillion Clubs? Jack and Jill organizations? I didn't have the right answers. These were class markers I hadn't needed before.

When Jimmy and I both got cut from teams, he started cheerleading anyway. "Who are we?! U of D!!" If Jimmy had the audacity to stand up and cheer after being cut, I could too. Standing in front of bleachers, screaming until hoarse, claiming space and refusing to apologize—this felt authentic in a way careful classroom performance never had.

A girl's boyfriend threatened me for visiting her at YMCA camp. He was a popular athlete. At the next game, I brought Glenn Burch—6'5", cornrowed, imposing. We sat in bleachers that emptied in a five-foot radius around us, claiming my space and daring anyone to challenge it. Jimmy was the first to approach: "Hey D. Hey Glenn." He broke the ice, and slowly others followed.

Father Radloff's Ethics class explored the Final Option Theory: daily choices becoming habits, habits becoming character. We debated abortion—not to learn what to believe, like Metropolitan taught, but to open doors for exploration. I was learning to think beyond right answers, to consider multiple perspectives, to build arguments from first principles.

**Winter's Bluff**

One winter evening during high school, Leslie picked me up in her Land Rover to shoot hoops at Northwest Rec Center. She was older, confident, someone who moved through the world with an ease I was still learning to fake.

The parking lot was empty except for a group of guys leaning against a car, passing something between them. As we got out, one of them called out: "Yo, what's a fine girl like you doing with that punk?"

The others laughed, moving toward us with the casual menace of young men testing boundaries.

Leslie didn't flinch. She reached for her jacket zipper, pulling it down slowly, deliberately. The guys froze, suddenly uncertain.

"I'm strapped," she said quietly, voice flat and certain. "And I will shoot you."

The air changed. Whatever they saw in her eyes made them recalculate. They backed away, hands up, muttering excuses.

We got in the car. Leslie zipped her jacket back up—no gun, just the bluff—and drove away with the windows down, winter air rushing in, her laughter mixing with my disbelief.

"You weren't—"

"No," she said. "But they didn't know that."

I'd just witnessed code-switching of a different kind. Not intellectual superiority or careful politeness, but the ability to read a dangerous situation and become whoever you needed to be to survive it. Leslie had learned something I was still figuring out: performance wasn't just about earning approval. Sometimes it was about staying safe.

The lesson stayed with me: the same intelligence I used to navigate classrooms could navigate streets, if I learned to read contexts correctly and adjust my presentation to match the stakes.

---

But performance had its costs. I'd retreat to intellectual superiority when threatened. I'd consume entire boxes of Entenmann's chocolate chip cookies during anxious afternoons, anxiety eating me from inside. A relationship imploded over my condescending comments about her drug use—I was right about the drugs, wrong about how I said it, blind to how my superiority pushed people away.

And at home, I grew weary of Mom's controlling nature. She never ASKED me to do something. She said "Derrick, you can sweep the floor. Derrick, you can take out the trash. Derrick, you can..." I had no opportunity to respond because my opinion was not solicited.

"Derrick, before you go, you can wash my car."

The resentment built through high school—not dramatic fights, but a slow estrangement, a growing distance between what she demanded and who I was becoming.

Senior year, two white classmates stood in the lunch line. Progressive parents. They'd chosen to attend Detroit's U of D instead of suburban schools. One said to the other, loud enough for me to hear: "I heard you got into Princeton. You don't deserve it. You're going to fail."

The valedictorian stood silent, complicit in his silence.

I walked away. My steps were firm. I knew where I was going.

I'd learned to read situations and present the right version of myself. I'd learned which performances earned approval and which invited attack. I'd learned that intellectual mastery was my superpower and my prison. I'd learned that with girls I could be vulnerable and natural, but with dominance-seeking boys I had to maintain armor. I'd learned that Jimmy's humor and Glenn's physical presence were weapons as powerful as my intelligence. I'd learned that Father Radloff's ethics—daily choices becoming habits—meant I wasn't just switching between performances anymore. I was choosing who I wanted to become.

But I also learned that deep, emotionally fulfilling relationships created safe spaces to explore who I actually was beneath the performances. Brother Jimmy, James Wardell, Doctor Jones asking "What do YOU think?"—these were the people who reminded me that performance and authenticity didn't have to be enemies.

The skills would serve me well: navigating spaces as the only one, turning underestimation into advantage, making my voice heard when others preferred I stay quiet. But the question remained: Was I performing identity or discovering it? And would I ever find spaces where I didn't have to perform at all?

Princeton loomed ahead—the ultimate test of whether performance would be enough.


================================================================================


Chapter 5: Strategic Excellence

Dad made the suggestion during a quiet drive back from Lawrence Tech Mathematics Club. "You should join the debate team."

The words hung in the air between us—both gift and confession. Perhaps he was seeing in me the voice he wished he'd claimed for himself. Perhaps he was simply noticing my talent for argument. Either way, I heard the invitation: find your voice, make it heard, claim space that I never could.

But I didn't join debate. I joined Model UN instead.

Debate meant arguing positions assigned to you. Model UN meant representing countries on a world stage, researching their histories and interests, building alliances, crafting resolutions. We'd won two consecutive national championships. I wanted that national stage. I wanted to prove I belonged among the best, not just in Detroit classrooms but in ballrooms filled with students from across the country.

David and Eric, both juniors, were looking for a third team member. They offered me—a senior—a spot. The regional competition was weeks away.

We got Yemen. Not a major power with automatic attention. A minor delegation that would have to earn every moment at the microphone. But that was fine. I'd spent years learning that preparation mattered more than prestige, that being underestimated could be an advantage if you were ready to prove them wrong.

During lunch in the Commons—long tables with bench seating where I'd once felt isolated—I researched. Yemen's strategic position on the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi influence. Palestinian rights stance. Soviet relationships. Oil politics. I built our position like programming code: if they say this, we respond with that. If this country objects, we ally with these two instead.

The competition took us out of town. We were the only Black delegation in the room. I watched others underestimate us, saw them focus on major powers, saw them assume three Black kids from Detroit wouldn't command attention.

They were wrong.

I approached the podium with the same focused preparation that had won mathematics competitions, the same strategic thinking that had navigated U of D's social complexities, the same careful performance that had earned teacher approval since kindergarten. But this time, the performance felt different. This wasn't compliance or code-switching or pretending to be less threatening. This was using voice as power, claiming space I'd earned through preparation.

"Distinguished delegates, the Republic of Yemen rises to address the critical issue of regional stability..."

The words came like the predictable logic of computer code. Our careful preparation gave me control. My voice carried across the room—not loud, but confident. Clear. Authoritative. I'd learned from Doctor Jones how to command attention, from Father Radloff how to build ethical arguments, from Mr. Zybrad how to think strategically, from years of performance how to read rooms and adjust approach.

We won Major Speaker Award. Best Minor Delegation Award. I was irritated we weren't competing for Best Major—the limitations of being Yemen instead of USA or USSR. But we'd transformed ourselves from outsiders into leaders. We'd used the same skills that helped us survive as Black students in white spaces to excel on a national stage.

Dad picked me up after the competition. The certificate sat on my lap.

"How'd it go?"

"We won the Best Minor Delegation Award as a team and I won a Major Speaker award."

His slight smile said more than words. Pride. Recognition. Perhaps some satisfaction that I'd found my voice, even if not in the way he'd suggested.

---

At fifteen and a half, I got a job at KFC on Van Dyke and Seven Mile. Popping frozen thigh bones. Breading chicken. Flour dust and blood. Debbie the cashier was almost twenty-one, friendly until the day she said it:

"You are not black!"

Horror in her voice. Disgust. As if I'd been deceiving her.

"Yes, in fact, I am," I replied with ironic smile.

Her discomfort was no longer my problem to solve. I'd learned that some people's racism required them to categorize me in ways that made them comfortable, and I didn't owe them compliance.

I biked to work in Detroit winters, putting gas in my parents' cars with my earnings. When Mom noticed—"Derrick, did you put gas in the car?"—something shifted. "Yes, Mom." "Well... thank you." I was contributing, not just consuming. I was helping, not just being helped.

Glenn Burch and Jimmy Latham got hired too. We were growing up together, sharing more than school and neighborhood now. We were becoming men who worked, who contributed, who stood on our own feet while still having each other's backs.

---

Then Aunt Mae died.

The call came during dinner. Mom's fork clattered against her plate as she listened, her face draining of color. Cancer. The word hung in our kitchen like a physical presence. Two months, they said. Just two months.

I was deep in my teenage self-absorption—work schedules, school assignments, girls, college applications—when Aunt Mae's diagnosis shattered our world. The woman who had taught me about unconditional love through ice cream and hymns was slipping away, and Mom wouldn't let me see her.

"No, Derrick. I don't want you to remember her like this."

But I already had memories I couldn't shake. The last time I'd visited her house, before we knew she was sick, she'd seemed smaller somehow. Her movements were slower, her legendary hugs a bit weaker. But her "Shug!" still carried all the warmth it always had.

The day she died, Mom didn't come out of her room. Through the door, I could hear her crying—not the sharp, angry sobs that sometimes came after fighting with me, but a deep, wounded sound I'd never heard before. It wasn't crying. It was wailing, a sound that came from somewhere primal and broken.

Dad moved through the house like a ghost, bringing her tea she wouldn't drink, speaking in whispers when he had to speak at all.

After the funeral, our house felt like it was underwater—everything moved slower, sounds were muffled, colors seemed dimmer. Mom went through the motions of daily life like an actress who'd forgotten why she'd taken the role. Her voice, usually sharp with purpose, became flat and distant. Even her corrections of my behavior seemed hollow.

But even in her grief, even through the fog of depression that would take nearly a decade to lift, Mom never lost sight of her mission for me. If anything, her determination to see me succeed grew stronger, as if my achievement could somehow fill the void Aunt Mae's death had left.

College wasn't just an option—it was an imperative. The unspoken part hung in the air: You're going to live the life Aunt Mae wanted for all of us.

Aunt Mae's death was like closing a door to my favorite room painted in my favorite color with my favorite toys. If we had music, it would have been playing a Stevie Wonder song. I got a glimpse of the room, heard the music from Songs in the Key of Life, and the door shut.

Silence. Darkness. Loneliness.

I shut my eyes. Blocked out the memories of the song. Focused inward. Connecting to people was dangerous. Those connections could be severed. I need to stop connecting. Stop it, just like I stopped crying. Don't feel. Nothing can bother me. Stay inside my head. It is safe there.

Where Mom's grief overflowed for years, mine froze solid. I felt alone. Adrift. Unmoored. Disconnected from family. But I accepted her death quickly, efficiently, completely. I didn't allow myself to feel it—not for a decade.

The contrast between us was stark: Mom wailed behind closed doors while I perfected my emotional shutdown. She couldn't stop feeling; I couldn't start. Both of us were drowning in different ways.

---

The application process was systematic, like programming. My credentials were strong: Model UN championships, Mathematics Club competitions, KFC job showing work ethic, grades near perfect, test scores high. Father Polakiwski urged University of Michigan. Mr. Gulock and Doctor Morton pointed to MIT. The valedictorian mentioned Princeton: "It's the best school in the country."

Mom had been buying U.S. Savings Bonds since I was four—$25, $50, $100 denominations adding up to an impressive but insufficient amount. I'd need scholarships.

Night after night, I sat at Dad's old typewriter with its green keys, crafting applications. Detroit Public Library for reference books. College Guidance office for forms. Every application perfect. Every essay tailored. Every recommendation requested from teachers who knew my work.

MIT and Michigan acceptances came in December 1980. Thick envelopes that meant yes. They were good schools, but they weren't the dream.

Princeton's envelope came April 1981.

I opened it at home, in the front hallway next to where the mail chute deposited mail into the closet. "Dear Derrick, Congratulations..."

I ran to tell Mom. She danced in a circle, saying how proud she was of me.

A few weeks later, the Western Union Mailgram came. Bell Labs Cooperative Scholarship—full tuition plus room and board plus monthly stipend plus summer employment plus no obligation to work for Bell Labs after graduation. The door was completely open.

I visited MIT with Mark, a U of D graduate now studying physics. His dorm smelled like marijuana smoke. When he showed me his midterm—physics score "above the mean!"—they celebrated. I didn't understand celebrating failure until he explained: "No, man, you don't get it. The mean was 20 out of 100. I got 25. That's good!" The culture of accepting failure, even celebrating it, made me uncomfortable.

Leslie, a Mercy graduate at Princeton, painted a different picture during her visit home. Enthusiasm. Possibility. A place where excellence was expected, not exceptional.

---

In the lunch line senior year, I overheard those two white classmates again. Progressive parents who'd chosen Detroit's integrated school. One had gotten into Princeton.

"I heard you got into Princeton. You don't deserve it. You're going to fail."

The valedictorian said nothing. His silence was complicity.

I walked away. My steps were firm. I knew where I was going, and I knew I belonged there.

---

I was standing on the threshold between the world I knew and the world I was about to enter. I'd learned to navigate spaces as the only one. I'd learned to turn underestimation into advantage. I'd learned to make my voice heard when others preferred I stay quiet. I'd learned the difference between performing and being, between surviving and thriving, between armor and authentic strength.

But I'd also learned that these skills—reading contexts, adapting presentation, strategic performance—could serve me or imprison me depending on whether I chose them or they chose me. Father Radloff's Final Option Theory echoed: daily choices becoming habits, habits becoming character.

I'd chosen Model UN over debate, finding my voice in a way that felt authentically mine rather than following Dad's suggestion exactly. I'd chosen to contribute gas money, shifting my relationship with parents from dependent to collaborator. I'd chosen to walk away from racist comments with firm steps rather than engaging with explanations or anger.

These were choices. Not performances, but decisions about who I wanted to become.

Princeton waited. The ultimate test of whether performance would be enough, or whether I'd finally have to figure out who I was beneath all the carefully constructed presentations.

I'd spent eighteen years learning to be exceptional—in classrooms, on stages, in competitions. I'd spent eighteen years learning that love required achievement, that belonging required performance, that being chosen meant proving I was worth choosing.

But I'd also spent weekends with hands covering mine on ice cream cranks, knowing unconditional love existed. I'd found Brother Jimmy and others exactly like me, learning that sometimes family finds you in unexpected places. I'd discovered Doctor Jones asking "What do YOU think?" showing me that my voice mattered beyond correct answers.

The question wasn't whether I could succeed at Princeton. The question was whether I could succeed without losing myself in the process.

My steps were firm. I knew where I was going.

The journey toward understanding the difference between walls and bridges was just beginning.
