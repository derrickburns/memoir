Chapter 18: The Sabbatical

**Early 1997 - Convergence**

By early 1997, everything was collapsing.

At SGI, the company that had peaked at $7 billion in 1995 was hemorrhaging value. We'd built Ferraris in a world that wanted Toyotas. The stock price was sliding—$45 at the peak, now hovering around $25 and falling. My GM role felt increasingly political, less about technical merit, more about navigating conflicts I didn't understand with customers I'd never met.

I'd missed Netscape. Jim Clark's offer in late 1994—the one I'd been too afraid to accept—had turned into billions. Marc Andreessen was on the cover of Time magazine. Kipp Hickman and Michael Toy, my former SGI colleagues, were now wealthy beyond measure.

Every stock ticker update felt personal.

At home, the strain was visible. Gina had withdrawn emotionally. When I came in from work, the response was muted: "Hi Dad." A glance. A nod. After she put the kids to bed, there was little energy left for me. "Goodnight, I'm tired."

Christmas morning 1995 had revealed something I couldn't ignore: I couldn't get out of bed to be present with my children. The comforter pulled over my head. Maya calling "Daddddd?!" Gina's eyes meeting mine with barely concealed pain.

That was the truth beneath all the performances.

And the depression that had surfaced that morning hadn't gone away. It just became the baseline. Wake up. Go to work. Come home. Retreat. Repeat.

In January 1997, the social file had finally arrived. Harvard College 1960, University of Michigan Law School 1963. The clue I'd missed for seven years. I'd called Mr. Littlejohn with the new information. He was searching again.

By March, I was drowning. SGI was failing. My marriage was strained. My search had hit another wall—seven years of law libraries, only to discover Burton had died in 1971.

And then the sabbatical offer came.

Ten weeks. Officially for home repairs and dissertation work. Really, it was escape. Escape from watching SGI die. Escape from the marriage I didn't know how to repair. Escape from the performance of being fine when everything was breaking.

But it was also necessity. If Mr. Littlejohn found something, I needed time to pursue it. Time I couldn't take while pretending to function at work.

Gina supported the sabbatical, but I could see the worry in her eyes. "Just be prepared for anything," she cautioned. "People have complex reasons for the choices they make."

I wasn't prepared. But I took the sabbatical anyway.

**March 3, 1997 - Grandfather's Words**

The fax machine in my home office whirred to life, spitting out pages from Mr. Littlejohn. I'd been waiting for this since our last call.

Two days earlier, on February 26, I'd found William Burton Golden in the Social Security Death Index. May 18, 1971. San Rafael, California. Dead at 32, when I was seven years old, still collecting matchbox cars and playing in Aunt Mae's yard, completely unaware that death had already sealed a door I hadn't yet discovered existed.

The shock had been visceral—years of searching, only to find permanent absence.

But now this fax. The first page was an autobiographical sketch written by James R. Golden—William's father. My grandfather.

A cold ripple passed through me as I read his words about his son. Here was something tangible, not redacted probate documents or legal directories, but a father's account of his child. My father. Words written by a man I'd never meet, about another man I'd never meet, both connected to me by blood I'd never shared.

The second page listed William's sister: Mrs. Phyllis Butler, practicing attorney in Detroit. Work address. Phone number.

Living family members within reach.

I stared at that phone number for a long time. This woman, my aunt, might not even know I existed. She'd lived her life in Detroit, practicing law, while I grew up just miles away.

At SGI, things were deteriorating. The company had peaked at $7 billion market capitalization in 1995. Now we were building Ferraris in a world that wanted Toyotas. The mismatch was becoming impossible to ignore, and my leadership role felt increasingly political, less about technical merit.

But in this moment, holding my grandfather's words, Silicon Valley felt very far away.

I picked up the phone.

**March 5, 1997 - First Call to Phyllis**

"Hello, my name is Derrick Burns. You don't know me, but I have some news to share with you. I am your late brother's son."

Silence on the other end. Then: "Is this a prank? Are you mistaken? Why are you calling me?"

Her voice carried shock, confusion, and something else—suspicion.

"I understand this is overwhelming," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I found your brother's name through the Probate Court and Mr. Littlejohn at the Wolverine Bar Association. I have documentation—"

"This isn't the right time or place," she interrupted. "Give me your number. I'll call you back from home."

She gave me her home phone number and hung up.

I sat in my office, phone still in hand, Maya's and Jamil's voices drifting up from downstairs where Gina was helping with homework. Two worlds: the family I had, and the family I was trying to find.

**March 1997 - Second Call to Phyllis**

When Phyllis called back, her voice was still guarded, but she listened.

She knew nothing about her brother having a child. She speculated—maybe I was the son of his girlfriend Susan, a white woman she remembered from those days.

I told her everything I could think of to reassure her. My loving upbringing. My happy family—wife, two children. Princeton. My career at Silicon Graphics. Anything to make her understand I wasn't after something from her.

"I just want to know about him," I said. "About my father."

But even as I said it, I knew it wasn't entirely true. I did want something from Phyllis, though I couldn't articulate what. It wasn't money—our careers provided comfortably. It wasn't love—I had wonderful loving parents.

It was something else. Recognition. Belonging. Proof that I came from somewhere.

Phyllis seemed to soften slightly. We talked for nearly an hour. She told me a few things about Burton—brilliant, troubled, charismatic. But I could feel her holding back, protecting something.

"I'll think about this," she said before hanging up. "Give me some time."

**March 1997 - Third Call to Phyllis (The Door Closes)**

The third call was different.

"Why are you looking for your father?" Phyllis's voice was sharp, hostile. "Most people seek their mother!"

The question hit me like an accusation. Why hadn't I searched for my birth mother first?

"I—I don't know," I stammered. "It just seemed natural to look for my father. Someone I identified with, a well-educated Black man—"

"You don't know anything about my brother," she cut me off. "You don't know what you're asking for."

Beneath her hostility, I sensed deeper fear—an instinctive guarding of family legacy. What was she protecting?

"I'm not trying to cause problems," I said. "I just want to understand—"

"I think we're done here," she said. "Goodbye, Mr. Burns."

The line went dead.

I sat there, staring at the phone. Another dead end. Burton was gone. Phyllis had shut the door. The paternal line had led nowhere but absence and rejection.

**March 1997 - Karen's Call**

My black lucent Merlin phone lit up at 7 PM—unusual for an outside line.

"Hello, may I please speak to Derrick?"

"This is he."

"This is Karen Butler. I believe you spoke to my mother, Phyllis Butler."

"Hello Karen!" Excitement surged through me. After Phyllis's hostility, I'd thought my quest had ended.

Her voice carried warmth that contrasted sharply with her mother's defensive tone. Where Phyllis had been guarded, Karen's words flowed with genuine curiosity.

"I wanted to reach out," she said. "My mother mentioned your calls, and I thought—well, I thought you deserved at least a conversation. Whatever the truth is, shutting the door completely didn't seem right."

We talked for over an hour. She was analytical, fair-minded—like the attorneys in her family. She wanted to understand. She asked questions without accusation.

"Would you be willing to meet?" she asked finally. "I'd like to hear your story in person."

"Yes," I said. "Absolutely."

We agreed on Fishbones in Greektown. A week from now.

After we hung up, I sat in my office, hope rekindling. The paternal line hadn't closed after all. It had just found a different path.

**March 1997 - Meeting Karen at Fishbones**

I arrived twenty minutes early, claiming a corner table where I could watch the door. My palms were damp despite the air conditioning.

When Karen walked in, time dilated. She navigated between tables with confident grace, scanning faces until our eyes locked across the crowded room.

Something clicked instantly—not quite recognition, but uncanny familiarity, as if meeting someone I'd known in a forgotten dream.

Her light skin and curly hair reminded me not of myself, but of the girls I'd found attractive during my adolescence. The ironic realization that she was "my type" made me chuckle inwardly. A bullet dodged indeed.

We talked for three hours. The conversation flowed with surprising ease—we discovered shared interests that went beyond coincidence. The intellectual rapport felt both strange and natural. Strangers with the unconscious rhythms of family.

"We probably know some of the same people," she said. "I went to Mercy High School."

As we talked, we discovered overlapping social worlds. People I knew from U of D knew people she knew from Mercy. Detroit's Black professional community was smaller than I'd realized.

"For what it's worth," Karen said as we were leaving, "I believe you. I don't know what happened with my uncle, but I believe you're his son. There's something—" She paused, searching for words. "You remind me of my family. The way you think."

For the first time, I felt a bond with people who thought like me. Intellectual kinship that went beyond mere genetic connection. Here was tangible proof that my analytical mind hadn't emerged from nowhere but had roots in a lineage I was only beginning to discover.

**April 1997 - Contact with Althea**

Through Karen and later, grudgingly, through Phyllis, I learned that Burton had married a concert pianist named Althea Robinson. They'd had twin daughters—Angela and Jennifer, born in 1969.

I had two half-sisters. One living in New York City near her mother and stepfather. The other teaching at Phillips Andover Academy in Massachusetts.

I wrote Althea a letter. Days later, she called.

Her voice was warm, open—so different from Phyllis's guardedness. She seemed genuinely pleased to hear from me.

"I have so much to tell you about Burton," she said. "About his family. When can we meet?"

We talked for an hour. She told me Burton had been brilliant, complicated, struggled with things she didn't fully explain over the phone. She mentioned he'd been "treated" at the time of his death—a hint at circumstances I'd learn more about later.

"The girls aren't ready to meet you yet," she said gently. "But maybe someday. Give them time."

I sent an email to Angela at PC Magazine where Karen said she worked. No response.

But Althea's warmth was unexpected. Another door opening where I'd expected only walls.

**April 21, 1997 - Sabbatical Begins**

I began a 10-week sabbatical from Silicon Graphics. Originally, I'd planned home repairs and dissertation work.

Instead, I found myself pulled toward two life-changing pursuits: interviewing with Virage for a much-needed career change, and finally, seriously searching for my birth mother.

SGI was dying. The company I'd joined as a summer intern in 1987, where Marc Hannah had built a 3D graphics powerhouse, where I'd belonged without explanation—it was collapsing under market forces it couldn't control.

The sabbatical felt like escape and necessity both. A break from watching something die. Freedom to search while I still could.

Gina supported me wholeheartedly but worried about what the search might stir up emotionally.

"Just be prepared for anything," she cautioned one night, her eyes meeting mine over her cup of tea. "People have complex reasons for the choices they make."

Maya was six, Jamil was four. They were building Lego cities in the living room, their voices a constant soundtrack. Gina managed them while working full-time at Kaiser, where she'd founded the Spanish Module two years earlier.

And I was about to fly to Detroit to look for a woman who'd given me away 33 years ago.

With my days free from corporate demands, I could fully dedicate myself to the search.

Phyllis's question haunted me: "Why are you looking for your father? Most people seek their mother!"

Why hadn't I thought to look for my birth mother first? It had seemed natural to seek my birth father—someone I identified with as a well-educated, presumably successful Black man.

But now, with Burton dead and the paternal search hitting walls, I turned toward the other half of my story.

I had her birthdate: April 13, 1941. Her siblings' birthdates from the social file. I knew her mother was born in Detroit. From the redacted documents, I'd deduced the number of letters in her first and last names.

I posted these facts to an internet mailing list of adoptees. Most responses were well-wishes, but one stood out. Daryl Royal from Dearborn, also born at Crittenton Hospital, suggested examining the Detroit Legal News for birth notices. Back issues at the Detroit Public Library.

Forward searching, not backward. Building from fragments.

I booked a flight to Detroit for early June.

**June 4, 1997 - Detroit Public Library**

Landing in Detroit felt like a strange mixture of homecoming and hunting. This city had shaped my adoptive life and, unknowingly, held the secrets of my biological beginnings. Two separate worlds existing in the same geographic space for decades.

The main branch of the Detroit Public Library on Woodward Avenue was magnificent—Italian Renaissance architecture, white Vermont marble façade gleaming in the morning light. I felt both intimidated and hopeful as I climbed the steps.

Inside, I was directed to the Burton Historical Collection. Classical details, hushed reverence, ornate murals depicting Detroit's history watching over genealogical researchers.

The librarian, an older gentleman whose silver-rimmed glasses reflected genuine interest, listened to my mission.

"Forward searching is harder than backward," he noted with a knowing smile. "But you've come to the right place."

Methodically, I began searching birth notices for April 13, 1941—my birth mother's birthdate. Each turn of a page tightened my chest with anticipation. These weren't just old records. They were stepping-stones toward my own truth.

Hours passed. I compiled female births from that date. Only two surnames had nine letters, matching what I'd deduced from the redacted documents.

Then, in the March 17, 1944 issue, I found a matching name for my birth mother's sister's birthdate.

Rosenberg.

Both announcements shared the same address: 3314 Cortland, Detroit.

My heart raced. Adrenaline pumped through my body.

Using the Detroit City Directory, I connected dots to identify my maternal grandparents: Irving and Ida Rosenberg.

I called Jimmy Latham, my best friend from high school who'd also been adopted from Crittenton. His excited voice crackled through my phone.

"Man, that's incredible! You're actually finding them!"

His enthusiasm bolstered mine. He understood the significance in a way others couldn't.

The librarian suggested checking Mumford High School yearbooks—the school nearest the Wisconsin Street address I'd found.

"They've got them in the Michigan Room," he said.

**June 4, 1997 - The Moment**

I held the 1958 Mumford High School yearbook carefully. The pages were brittle with age.

The school was virtually entirely white and predominantly Jewish—a stark contrast to the nearly all-Black Mumford of today. The racial transformation of Detroit, visible in these yearbooks, had shaped my very existence.

I turned pages slowly, scanning June graduates.

Then I saw her name: Marcia Rosenberg.

I looked at the photograph.

Time stopped.

"That's ME!"

The words nearly escaped my lips. I caught them just in time—the library was silent around me.

My peripheral vision vanished as I locked onto the image. My jaw dropped.

I was looking at my own face.

After thirty-three years, I was finally seeing someone who shared my blood, my features, my genetic heritage. The sensation transcended surreal—like discovering a photograph of myself in a stranger's album, wearing clothes I'd never owned.

My hands trembled as I stared into eyes that mirrored my own. The hazel eyes people had always asked about. The face that had never quite looked like anyone in my family.

Here. In a 1958 yearbook. A girl named Marcia Rosenberg.

My birth mother.

What had begun as methodical genealogy transformed in an instant into something viscerally personal. This wasn't just a woman in a yearbook. This was someone whose features I'd carried every day of my life without knowing where they came from.

I found her sister Sheryl in the 1961 yearbook. Same eyes. Same face shape.

I called Gina from a payphone in the library lobby.

"I found her," I said simply.

Pause. Then her voice, gentle and cautious: "How do you feel?"

It was a loaded question. I hadn't fully processed my emotions yet.

"Like I've opened a door I can't close," I replied.

Gina, ever practical even while being supportive, helped me search online from California. Within an hour, she'd found Irving and Ida Rosenberg living in West Bloomfield, just 30 miles away.

My birth mother's parents. Still alive. Still in Michigan.

The proximity was staggering.

**June 5, 1997 - Wisconsin Street**

Before returning to research, I visited U of D High School—my alma mater.

Mrs. Mary Voss, the secretary whose maternal warmth had been constant during my teenage years, was still there.

"Derrick Burns!" she exclaimed, using my adoptive name with familiar affection and authority. "Look at you, all grown up and successful!"

Our conversation felt like a bridge between my established identity and the one I was now discovering.

Afterward, I drove to Wisconsin Street.

3314 Cortland was the address from the birth notices, but the family had moved. Through the city directory, I'd traced them to Wisconsin Street.

I stood outside the house, four streets west of U of D High School.

Four streets.

Wisconsin Street! Not some vague "Detroit" that meant the suburbs. This was real Detroit, mere blocks from where I'd spent my teenage years. The streets I'd walked daily. The neighborhood I knew intimately.

All those years searching for connection, and she'd been literally around the corner.

How many times had our paths nearly crossed? Had we passed each other on Livernois Avenue? At the corner store?

The geographic coincidence left me both cheated and oddly comforted.

I'd been looking for her across the country, in legal directories and probate files.

And she'd been right here. Four streets from my high school.

**June 5, 1997 - Marriage Records**

At Mumford High, I'd noticed Marcia's middle initial in the yearbook: R.

At the City-County building, I searched marriage records.

Marcia Rene Rosenberg married Robert Zelman Feldstein, August 27, 1961.

Divorced October 1, 1963.

Just months before my birth in April 1964.

She'd married again—Robert Joel Brown, June 29, 1969.

Both husbands were attorneys who'd graduated from prestigious universities.

A pattern emerged. Educated partners. Divorce timing significant—I'd been conceived shortly after her first divorce.

I sat in the records room, surrounded by dusty ledgers, piecing together her life from legal documents.

She'd been 22 when she married the first time. 22 when she divorced. 23 when she got pregnant with me.

What had happened in those months between divorce and my birth?

**June 5, 1997 - The Letter**

On May 9, Deborah Johnson had been appointed my "confidential search intermediary" by Wayne County Probate Court.

Now, sitting in my hotel room with marriage records and yearbook photos spread across the desk, Deb called.

"I found her," she said. "I have her phone number."

My heart stopped.

"I was planning to call Monday, but—"

"I'm leaving for New York Saturday morning," I interrupted. "I'm here now. Is there any way—"

"Let me call my partner for permission to contact her sooner," Deb said. "Meanwhile, can you fax me the letter you wrote? I'll read it to her over the phone."

I sat down to write the most significant letter of my life.

How do you write to a mother who gave you away 33 years ago?

How do you balance honesty with sensitivity? Yearning with respect for boundaries?

I wrote carefully:

---

*Dear Mother,*

*I imagine that you are in a state of shock right now wondering is this really true, is this my son, and if so, why is he contacting me after all these years?*

*My search for you actually started seven years ago, when my wife became pregnant with our first child. My concerns arose from my heart not my head. After 26 years of looking at other people and seeing no one that looked like me, I faced the prospect of having my own child and seeing for the first time someone that looked like me.*

*Seven years later I continue my search. I know that you are near. I feel your presence and I yearn to reach out to see you.*

*I now have two wonderful children, a girl, age 6, and a boy, age 4. My wife and I are happily married and share a beautiful home in Northern California. We are both graduates of Ivy League schools. She is a physician and I am an engineering director at a Silicon Valley computer firm. My (adoptive) parents provided me with wonderful opportunities in life and I am eternally grateful.*

*You have a separate life now, one that does not include me. I do not wish to intrude on your life. I bear no ill will nor do I feel pain. I wish only to meet the woman that gave me life, and, if you are willing, to get to know you. Please find it in your heart to see me.*

*Sincerely,*
*Your son "Michael"*

---

I signed it with the name she'd remember from the hospital. The name she'd given me before she gave me away.

I faxed it to Deb.

Then I waited.

**Evening, June 5, 1997 - Rejection**

Deb called that evening.

"I spoke with her," she said carefully.

My heart raced. "And?"

"She refused to confirm her identity. She wouldn't acknowledge having a child on April 6, 1964. She expressed outrage at being called late at night. She took my phone number but—"

The words hit like a punch.

Refused. Wouldn't acknowledge. Outrage.

After finding her face in the yearbook. After Wisconsin Street four blocks from my high school. After writing that letter.

Rejection.

"I'm sorry," Deb said. "Sometimes this happens. Birth mothers need time. Let's give her space and—"

"Okay," I said. "Thank you for trying."

I hung up and sat in the hotel room, staring at the marriage records and yearbook photos.

She didn't want to know me.

I'd found her, and she'd said no.

**June 13, 1997 - Packing for New York**

I was packing for my trip to New York—hoping to meet Althea, maybe my half-sisters—when the phone rang.

Deb Johnson.

"Derrick," her voice was excited. "She wants to talk to you. Your birth mother wants immediate phone contact. She wrote you a letter today. I'm going to fax it over right now."

I stood frozen. "She—what?"

"Check your fax machine. The letter should be coming through any second."

I ran to my home office. The fax machine whirred to life.

I watched the paper emerge inch by inch, as if the machine itself understood the weight of the moment.

The letterhead appeared first. Then handwriting—careful, controlled, elegant.

---

*Dearest Derrick,*

*I have waited thirty-three years to write this letter.*

*My search for you, like yours, began in my heart. It began April 6, 1964.*

*An image of a glass wall with a beautiful baby boy runs through my life...*

---

I read it once, clinical and detached, emotions held at distance.

Then I walked to the window, looked out at Mountain View streets, and returned to read it again.

Beyond the careful phrasing, I sensed a familiar emotional cadence—the guarded way she balanced vulnerability with self-protection.

This guarded approach to emotional expression wasn't just similar to mine. It was mine. Or rather, I had inherited it from her, carried it in my blood without ever knowing its source.

The careful, measured reaching out was as much a genetic inheritance as my eyes or the shape of my hands.

I recognized the source of why I approached emotional situations with careful analysis, why I processed feelings through the filter of intellect before allowing myself to experience them directly.

Emotional architecture inherited, not just physical features.

---

The letter ended:

*I wish you love. I wish you life. And the happiest of Father's Days to you.*

---

Father's Day was two days away.

I picked up the phone and dialed the number Deb had provided.

Each ring felt like crossing a threshold.

After thirty-three years of separation, what would be the first words between a mother and the son she had given away?

She answered on the third ring.

"Hello?"

"Marcia?" My voice sounded strange to my own ears. "This is Derrick. Your son."

Silence. Then, quietly: "I know."

We talked for an hour. Awkward, halting at first, then words flowing faster. She wanted to know everything—my childhood, Gina, my life in Detroit and at Princeton. I'd share stories and she would listen with rapt attention, perhaps trying to piece together the chapters of my life she had missed.

By the time we hung up, we'd arranged to meet when I got back from New York.

Her Birmingham apartment. Woodward Avenue.

Late June. Just a few weeks away.

I sat in my office after the call, the fax still in my hand.

In three months, I'd found my birth father's name (dead before I could meet him). Met my cousin Karen. Talked to my father's widow Althea. Started a sabbatical from a dying company. And found my birth mother's face in a 1958 yearbook four blocks from my high school.

Now I was about to meet her.

Gina appeared in the doorway. "You okay?"

I looked up. "She wants to meet me."

Gina crossed the room and put her hand on my shoulder. "I know."

"I'm scared," I admitted.

"I know that too," she said.

Maya and Jamil's voices drifted up from downstairs. Gina had been managing them all day while I talked on the phone, chased records, lived in the past.

"Go be with the kids," I said. "I'll be down in a minute."

She squeezed my shoulder and left.

I sat alone with Marcia's letter, my grandfather's autobiographical sketch about Burton, and the 1958 Mumford yearbook photo I'd photocopied.

Two families. One I'd never known. One I was about to meet.

And the family I had—Gina, Maya, Jamil, Mom, Dad—waiting patiently while I searched for something I couldn't name.

The sabbatical from SGI had become a sabbatical from my established identity.

And I was about to discover what lay on the other side.
