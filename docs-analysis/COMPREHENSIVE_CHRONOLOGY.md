## Major Chronology Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Boys Town in Chapter 3 (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Finalized Chapter 3 includes Boys Town scene
**Chapter 3 timeframe:** Ages 5-10
**Boys Town actual timing:** Age 12-13 (per author)
**Time discrepancy:** 5-7 years!

**Evidence:**
- Finalized Ch 3, line 323: "Those weekend visits stopped by age ten"
- Finalized Ch 3, lines 325-347: Boys Town scene immediately follows
- Chapter 7 context: Boys Town happens "that summer" after group home threat (age 12)

**Fix Required:** ❌ **Remove Boys Town from Chapter 3, keep in Chapter 7**

---

### Problem 2: Dad's Bowling Placement in Chapter 7

**Issue:** Bowling scene positioned AFTER later events
**Actual timing:** Age 7-8 (per author)
**Current placement:** Chapter 7, after cursive/chores (ages 9-10)

**Evidence:**
- Author confirms: "Probably when I was 7 or 8"
- Chapter 6 shows Dave arriving at age 7
- Bowling scene mentions "Dave and I" as established brothers
- But placed after content that seems to be ages 9-10

**Options:**
1. Move bowling scene earlier in Chapter 7 (right after Dave's arrival context)
2. Move bowling scene to Chapter 6 (if it happened immediately after Dave arrived)
3. Move bowling scene to Chapter 3 (if it fits the age 5-10 timeframe)

**Recommended:** Keep in Chapter 7 but reorder sections chronologically

---

### Problem 3: Age 8 Error in Chapter 9

**Issue:** Chapter 9, line 5 says "age 8" but describes U of D High
**Actual age:** 12-13 (7th grade)
**Error type:** Factual mistake

**Fix Required:** ❌ **Change "age 8" to "age 12" or remove age reference**

---

### Problem 4: Photo Date Confusion (Chapter 7)

**Issue:** Photo caption "Dave's Birthday, November 1975"
**Questions:**
- When was Dave born?
- How old was Derrick in 1975?
- Does this align with ages described in text?

**Need from author:**
- Dave's birth year
- Age of both boys in 1975 photo
- Clarify if this is during age 7-8 period or age 12-13 period

---

## Recommendations: Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Chapter 3 - Remove Boys Town (CRITICAL)

**Current (Finalized Ch 3):**
- Lines 233-323: Aunt Mae weekends (ages 5-10) ✓
- Line 323: "Those weekend visits stopped by age 10" ✓
- Lines 325-347: ❌ **Boys Town (age 12-13) - REMOVE THIS**

**Corrected Chapter 3 should end:**
- Line 323: "Those weekend visits stopped by age 10. I don't remember why."
- Then close with reflection on what Aunt Mae taught
- **Delete Boys Town scene entirely from Chapter 3**

**Keep Boys Town in Chapter 7** where it chronologically belongs (age 12-13)

---

### Fix 2: Chapter 7 - Reorder Sections Chronologically

**Current Order (Chapter 7):**
1. The Contrast (ages ~9-10)
2. Dad's Separate World / Bowling ❌ (age 7-8 per author)
3. Different Standards (ages ~9-10)
4. Summer Activities (ages ~9-10)
5. The Threat (age ~12)
6. Family Trips / Boys Town (age ~12-13)

**Corrected Order:**
1. **Dad's Separate World / Bowling** (age 7-8) - MOVE TO BEGINNING
2. The Contrast (ages ~9-10)
3. Different Standards (ages ~9-10)
4. Summer Activities (ages ~9-10)
5. The Threat (age ~12)
6. Family Trips / Boys Town (age ~12-13)

**Rationale:** Events should flow chronologically within chapter

---

### Fix 3: Chapter 9 Line 5 - Correct Age Error

**Current:**
"Mom dropped me off on her way to work at McDowell Elementary... age 8"

**Corrected:**
"Mom dropped me off on her way to work at McDowell Elementary..."
(Remove "age 8" entirely, or change to "I was twelve")

---

### Fix 4: Clarify Photo Dates

**Chapter 7, line 212:** "Dave's Birthday, November 1975"

**Questions for author:**
- When was Dave born?
- How old was Derrick in November 1975?
- Does this photo belong in age 7-8 section or age 12-13 section?

---

## Questions for Author

1. **Dave's birth year:** When was Dave born? This will anchor many timeline calculations.

2. **1975 photo timing:** The photo captioned "Dave's Birthday, November 1975" - how old were you both?

3. **Bowling alley confirmation:** You said bowling happened age 7-8. Should it appear:
   a. In Chapter 3 (if it's during Aunt Mae weekend years)?
   b. Early in Chapter 7 (right after Dave arrives)?
   c. Somewhere else?

4. **Boys Town confirmation:** You said Boys Town was age 12-13. Confirmed this should stay in Chapter 7, NOT in Chapter 3?

5. **Aunt Mae weekend visits:** These stopped at age 10. Was this before or after Dave arrived? (Dave arrived age 7, visits stopped age 10, so Dave would have gone to Aunt Mae's ages 7-10?)

## Summary: Chronology Fixes Required

| Chapter | Issue | Fix | Priority |
|---------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Ch 3 (Finalized)** | Boys Town included (age 12-13) | ❌ Remove Boys Town, keep only ages 5-10 content | **CRITICAL** |
| **Ch 7** | Bowling alley out of order | Reorder: Move bowling to beginning | **HIGH** |
| **Ch 7** | Keep Boys Town here | ✓ Belongs here (age 12-13) | **Confirm** |
| **Ch 9 Line 5** | Says "age 8" but describes age 12-13 | Change to "age 12" or remove | **MEDIUM** |
| **Ch 7 Line 212** | Photo date 1975 unclear | Clarify ages in photo caption | **LOW** |
