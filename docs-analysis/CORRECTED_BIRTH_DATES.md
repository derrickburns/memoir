## What This Changes

**Chapter 1:** Should clarify
- Born April 6, 1964
- Spent 5 weeks at maternity home
- Adopted May 12, 1964

**All other dates remain the same** - the correction affects only the birth/adoption distinction, not the ages in subsequent chapters.

## Files That Need Minor Updates

1. `FINAL_TIMELINE_AND_FIXES.md` - Update birth date
2. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Update birth date
3. `CONFIRMED_TIMELINE.md` - Update birth date

**Note:** These are documentation files only. The actual chapter content is correct because it focuses on the adoption date (May 12, 1964), which is accurate.
