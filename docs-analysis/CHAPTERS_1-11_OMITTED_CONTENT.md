## OVERALL SUMMARY

**Total Word Count Reduction:**
- Original Chapters 2-11: ~26,000 words
- Restructured Chapters 2-5 (covering same period): ~7,750 words
- **Reduction: 70% (compressed by 3.4x)**

**What Was Preserved:**
- Core emotional arc: loneliness → Dave → Aunt Mae → performance learning → Princeton
- Key relationships: Aunt Mae, Dave, Jimmy, Doctor Jones
- Critical realizations: conditional vs unconditional love, performance vs authenticity
- Major milestones: skipping grade, Law Middle School, Kim rejection, Eugene friendship/betrayal, U of D, Model UN, Aunt Mae's death, college acceptances

**What Was Sacrificed:**
- Nearly all extended scene work
- Most sensory and physical details
- Extensive dialogue
- Secondary characters (Cille, Mrs. Donaldson, many teachers, neighborhood kids)
- Complete scenes (Group Home threat, Boys Town extended, Northwest Rec bluff, bowling alley confrontation)
- Subplot details (summer activities, church basement, computer room extended, KFC job details)
- Transitional and reflective passages
- Documentary evidence (adoption report, scholarship letters, Mom's Bible entry)
- Photograph captions and descriptions
- "The Loneliest Desk" opening of Chapter 6 (~600 words of powerful loneliness description)

**Restructuring Choices:**
- Chapter 3 (Aunt Mae) was EXPANDED rather than compressed - only chapter to receive this treatment
- Chapters 6-11 experienced the most extreme compression
- Chapter 11 largely preserved as Chapter 5
- Montage/summary approach for ages 0-10
- Strategic scene selection for ages 11-17
- Emotional intimacy traded for pacing in most chapters except Aunt Mae

This compression allowed the memoir to reach Princeton by Chapter 6 instead of Chapter 12, accelerating the narrative significantly while attempting to preserve emotional core and thematic through-lines.
