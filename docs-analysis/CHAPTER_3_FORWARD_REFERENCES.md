## What Has Been Established in Chapters 1-2

### Chapter 1: "Two Worlds Converging"
- **Churches:** NONE mentioned
- **Mom's role:** Adopting mother, teacher (profession)
- **Setting:** Hospital goodbye, adoption placement

### Chapter 2: "The Perfect Shot"  
- **Churches mentioned:**
  - **Vernon Chapel AME Church** - Nursery school location, Rev. Brockington, "a few blocks away"
  - **Metropolitan Church** - "But we went to Metropolitan Church on Sundays, so I did not know these people"
- **Mom's role:** Teacher (profession), perfectionist parent
- **What's NOT mentioned:**
  - Primary Church as a concept/class
  - Mom teaching at church
  - Any specific scenes at Metropolitan Church

---

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** Earlier Draft Chapter 3 (Line 11) references "Primary Church" without establishing what it is

**Current Text:**
```
"No Primary Church this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the
right moments. No getting in trouble for whispering to Mary like last week when
Mom was our teacher..."
```

**What reader knows:** Family goes to Metropolitan Church on Sundays (mentioned once in Ch 2)

**What reader DOESN'T know:**
- What is "Primary Church"? (Sunday school class? Children's program?)
- Mom teaches at Metropolitan Church
- The performance pressure at church
- Who Mary is

**Effect:** Reader confusion - is this a different church? A class? When was this established?

## Same Issue in Finalized Version

**Finalized Chapter 3, Line 271:**
```
"It wasn't the formal, careful belonging of Primary Church at Metropolitan, where
Mom watched to make sure I sat still and acted right."
```

**Status:** ⚠ **SAME FORWARD REFERENCE** - Not fixed in finalized version

## Solutions

### Option 1: Add Context in Chapter 2 (RECOMMENDED)

**Location:** After Vernon Chapel scene in Chapter 2

**Add brief passage:**
```
At Metropolitan Church on Sundays, I attended Primary Church—the children's class
where Mom taught. She watched me carefully during lessons, making sure I sat
straight and didn't fidget. When I whispered to another child during Bible study,
she moved me to the front row where everyone could see my shame. The same high
expectations she had at home followed me into the pews.
```

**Effect:**
- Establishes "Primary Church" as Sunday school class
- Establishes Mom as teacher there
- Establishes performance pressure at church
- Makes Chapter 3 reference clear

**Length:** ~4-5 lines

### Option 2: Remove "Primary Church" Reference in Chapter 3

**Earlier Draft - Change Line 11:**

**FROM:**
```
No Primary Church this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the
right moments. No getting in trouble for whispering to Mary like last week when
Mom was our teacher and made me sit in the front row by myself, my face burning
while everyone stared.
```

**TO:**
```
No church at all this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the
right moments. No watching every word, every move. Just... being.
```

**Effect:**
- Removes forward reference
- Loses specific detail about church/Mom teaching
- More general but clearer

**Finalized Version - Change Line 271:**

**FROM:**
```
It wasn't the formal, careful belonging of Primary Church at Metropolitan, where
Mom watched to make sure I sat still and acted right.
```

**TO:**
```
It wasn't the formal, careful belonging of Metropolitan Church, where I had to
sit still and act right.
```

**Effect:**
- Removes "Primary Church" term
- Keeps the contrast
- Clearer to reader

### Option 3: Move Church Establishment Earlier in Chapter 3

**Add opening context paragraph:**
```
At home, Sundays meant Metropolitan Church—starched shirts, polished shoes, and
Primary Church class where Mom taught. She watched me carefully during Bible
lessons, her teacher-eyes never resting. Last week, I'd whispered to Mary during
the story about Moses, and Mom made me sit in the front row by myself, my face
burning while everyone stared.

But weekends at Aunt Mae's were different.
```

**Effect:**
- Establishes context before referencing it
- Front-loads the contrast
- Clearer narrative flow

## Recommendation

**Best Solution:** Option 1 (Add context in Chapter 2) + Option 2 (Simplify Chapter 3 reference)

**Why:**
1. Establishes church pattern early (Chapter 2)
2. Shows performance pressure exists everywhere, not just home
3. Makes Aunt Mae's refuge more powerful by contrast
4. Removes confusing terminology in Chapter 3

**Implementation:**

**Chapter 2 - Add after line 23 (Vernon Chapel paragraph):**
```
Sundays were different. At Metropolitan Church, I attended Primary Church—the
children's class where Mom taught. She watched me even more carefully there
than at home, her teacher-eyes tracking every fidget, every whisper. When I
talked to another child during Bible study, she moved me to the front row by
myself. My face burned while everyone stared. Even at church, I had to perform.
```

**Chapter 3 - Simplify line 11:**
```
No church this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the right
moments. No watching every move. Just being wanted.
```

**Result:**
- Reader understands church performance pressure from Chapter 2
- Chapter 3 reference lands clearly
- Aunt Mae's unconditional acceptance feels more powerful
- No forward references

## Other Potential Forward References to Check

### 1. "The Project" concept

**Check:** Is "The Project" (Mom's mission for Derrick) established early enough?

**Status:** TBD - need to verify in Chapters 1-2

### 2. Specific neighborhood references

**Check:** Are locations mentioned in Chapter 3 previously established?

**Status:** TBD - need to verify

### 3. Character names dropped without context

**Check:** Uncle John, Snuffy, Mrs. Clingman - do they return or are they expendable?

**Status:** Analysis in CHAPTER_3_ANALYSIS.md - Uncle John compressible, Mrs. Clingman expendable
