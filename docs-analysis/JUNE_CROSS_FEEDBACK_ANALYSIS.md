## Executive Summary

June Cross's feedback reveals 4 major editorial priorities that align strongly with the voice restoration work and quality standards we've established. Her concerns focus on **character development, information placement, clarity, and showing vs. telling**.

**Key Insight:** June is essentially asking for exactly what Derrick's authentic voice already provides - concrete scenes, character development through action, and clear chronological storytelling. Her feedback validates the voice restoration approach.

## The Four Major Themes

### 1. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - Introduce People Earlier (21 comments)

**The Problem:**
Characters are introduced late without sufficient development. Readers need to know people as individuals BEFORE they become important to the story.

**June's Feedback:**
> "also needed much, much earlier. We should know your dad as a person already by the time we get here"

> "it would be great to hint at this more in the earlier chapters"

> "would love to read more about this in the opening chapters of this book"

**What This Means:**
- Dad's character (bowling, numbers, tax prep) needs establishment in Chapter 1-2
- Emotional patterns should be hinted at earlier
- Identity questions (light skin, belonging) should appear in childhood chapters

**How to Fix:**
- Move character-establishing details forward to first mention
- Add concrete scenes showing character traits early
- Foreshadow major themes in opening chapters

---

### 2. STRUCTURE - Information Placement (12 comments)

**The Problem:**
Information appears out of chronological order or disconnected from related content. Scenes and facts would have more impact in different locations.

**June's Feedback:**
> "this fact would serve you better in chapter 1...you could refer to it again here"

> "somehow this feels like it should be closer to that anecdote you tell about you and Dave dawdling"

> "Why do you have that scene before you meet Frank? so is this Frank the one you built Netflix with?"

> "I'm wondering what would happen if you actually put the real story side by side instead of compartmentalizing them from each other. get some index cards (or use Google Slides) and put the chapters about trying to find your birth parents against the chapters of your career, and see what happens... there may be some synchronicity"

**What This Means:**
- Chronology matters - don't jump around without purpose
- Related content should be close together (Dad's bowling + family dinner scene)
- Consider interweaving parallel storylines (career + birth parent search)
- Technical/background info belongs at first mention, not later

**How to Fix:**
- Establish facts/traits at first mention, reference later
- Keep related content proximate
- Consider parallel narrative structure for major storylines
- Check chronological flow - time markers clear

### 3. CLARITY - Reader Confusion (7 comments)

**The Problem:**
Technical terms, pronouns, relationships, and timeframes confuse readers. What's clear to Derrick isn't clear to readers.

**June's Feedback:**
> "i'm a dunce. what does this mean?" (re: stock options accelerating on change of control)

> "what about her demeanor betrayed this?" (needs concrete details)

> "the family relationships are getting complicated. You could add 'They had twin daughters, Karen's nieces, Angela and Jennifer.'"

> "so how long is this after that initial effort to meet her? Important to keep your readers in time...the actual dates mean less than the time elapsed"

**What This Means:**
- Explain technical jargon (stock options, business terms)
- Clarify pronouns and relationships explicitly
- Use time elapsed, not just dates ("a week later" vs. "June 13")
- Show concrete details, don't just name abstract states

**How to Fix:**
- Define technical terms in plain language
- Make relationships explicit (use clarifying phrases)
- Add time markers (not just dates)
- Replace abstract statements with concrete showing

---

### 4. SHOW MORE, TELL LESS / EXPAND KEY MOMENTS (8+ comments)

**The Problem:**
Important moments are summarized in a few paragraphs when they deserve full scene treatment. Reader wants MORE detail on significant experiences.

**June's Feedback:**
> "how did you know the CEO? this seems like a positive experience for you, yet you dismiss it with 3 or 4 paragraphs. Inquiring minds want to know more....how you applied the lessons learned..."

> "this is the same way you begin the chapter. It has more emotional impact here. maybe just begin this chap with the letter you get from the probate court?"

> "why did you procrastinate? you were that distrustful of the folx around you?"

**What This Means:**
- Positive/transformative experiences deserve full scenes, not summaries
- Start chapters at the emotional high point
- Explore psychological motivations (why procrastinate?)
- Expand moments that teach lessons

**How to Fix:**
- Identify moments being rushed - give them full scene treatment
- Start chapters with strongest emotional beat
- Add interior psychological exploration
- Trust reader interest - they want MORE on important moments

---

## Secondary Themes

### Word Choice & Voice
- "overused phrase" - clichés like "the irony wasn't lost on me"
- Repeated words - "shifted" used too often
- Use synonyms, vary language

### Chronological Clarity
- Use time elapsed markers
- Keep timeline clear
- Don't confuse readers with jumps

### Family Relationships
- Clarify who is related to whom
- Use explicit relationship markers
- Don't assume reader remembers

## Alignment With Voice Restoration Work

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** June Cross's feedback is asking for exactly what Derrick's authentic voice already does:

| June's Request | Authentic Voice Provides |
|---|---|
| "Know Dad as a person earlier" | Concrete character-establishing scenes |
| "Show what betrayed her demeanor" | Specific sensory details, not abstractions |
| "Expand important moments" | Full scenes with dialogue, not summaries |
| "Clarify time/relationships" | Context before concepts |
| "More in earlier chapters" | Foreshadowing, pattern establishment |

**This validates the voice restoration approach:** Raw, concrete, scene-based writing naturally addresses June's concerns.

## June Cross's Implicit Editorial Philosophy

Based on 141 comments, June values:

1. **Chronological Clarity** - Keep readers oriented in time
2. **Character Before Plot** - Know people before events
3. **Concrete Over Abstract** - Show demeanor, don't just name emotions
4. **Reader Engagement** - "Inquiring minds want to know" = expand what's interesting
5. **Efficient Structure** - Put info where it first matters, reference later
6. **Emotional Impact** - Start with strongest beat, don't bury it

**Her philosophy matches:** Show don't tell, trust the reader, concrete details, character development through action.

## Integration with Current Work

### Matches Established Standards:

✅ **Chapter Quality Checklist**
- June's "clarity" theme → "concepts without context"
- June's "show more" theme → "too much telling"
- June's "know people" theme → "weak character development"

✅ **Voice Requirements**
- June wants concrete details → we restored those in Chapter 3
- June wants expansion → scenes not summaries
- June wants chronology → clear narrative flow

✅ **Book Focus**
- June's call to interweave career + birth parent search → supports "finding oneself"
- June's emphasis on early foreshadowing → establishes journey from walls to bridges

**Conclusion:** June Cross's feedback doesn't require NEW priorities. It validates and reinforces the work already in progress.

## Questions for Derrick

Based on June's feedback, consider:

1. **Parallel Structure:** Would interweaving career chapters with birth parent search chapters strengthen the "finding oneself" through-line?

2. **Dad's Character:** Should we add a Dad-focused section to Chapter 1 or 2 showing his bowling/numbers/quiet escape pattern?

3. **Identity Foreshadowing:** Should childhood chapters include more about navigating light skin questions and feeling different?

4. **Positive Moments:** Which "dismissed in 3-4 paragraphs" moments deserve full scene treatment?
