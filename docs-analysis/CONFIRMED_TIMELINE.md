## What Gets Fixed

### Fix 1: Chapter 3 - Remove Boys Town

**DELETE from finalized Chapter 3 (lines 325-347):**
```
**Boys Town**

One summer, we took a family road trip toward Los Angeles...
[entire Boys Town section through]
...Denver became our destination. LA remained a dream for another time.
```

**KEEP in Chapter 3:**
- Opening through age 10
- Aunt Mae weekends (ages 5-7 solo, ages 7-10 with Dave)
- Dad's bowling alley (age 7-8) ✓ BELONGS HERE
- End: "Those weekend visits stopped by age ten"
- Closing reflection on unconditional love

---

### Fix 2: Chapter 7 - Verify Current Order

**CURRENT Google Doc Chapter 7 order:**
1. The Contrast
2. Dad's Separate World / Bowling ← Age 7-8
3. Different Standards
4. Summer Activities
5. The Threat ← Age 12
6. Family Trips / Boys Town ← Age 12-13

**ISSUE:** Bowling (age 7-8) placed AFTER content from ages 9-10

**SOLUTION:**
- Bowling is already duplicated in finalized Chapter 3
- If we keep bowling in Chapter 3 (age 7-8), DELETE from Chapter 7
- OR: If we remove bowling from Chapter 3, reorder Chapter 7 to put bowling first

**DECISION NEEDED:** Where should bowling scene live?

**Option A:** Keep bowling in Chapter 3 ONLY
- Fits chronologically (age 7-8)
- Shows family dynamics during Aunt Mae years
- DELETE from Chapter 7

**Option B:** Keep bowling in Chapter 7 ONLY
- Reorder Chapter 7 to put bowling first
- DELETE from Chapter 3 (finalized version)

**Option C:** Keep in both places (current state)
- Problematic: duplicate content

---

### Fix 3: Chapter 9 - Correct Age Error

**Line 5 (current):**
"Mom dropped me off on her way to work at McDowell Elementary... age 8"

**Corrected:**
"Mom dropped me off on her way to work at McDowell Elementary..."
(Remove "age 8" - this is 7th grade, age 12-13)

## Key Insights from Timeline

### 1. Dave at Aunt Mae's (Ages 7-10)

**Duration:** 3 years (1972-1975)
**Significance:**
- Dave experienced Aunt Mae's unconditional love
- Shows it wasn't about Derrick being special
- Both boys received "Shug!"
- Creates shared experience of refuge

**Implication for Chapter 3:**
- Dave's presence at Aunt Mae's is ESSENTIAL
- This happened during ages 7-10 timeframe
- Belongs in Chapter 3 scope

### 2. Bowling Alley Timing (Age 7-8)

**When:** 1971-1972, right after Dave arrived
**Context:** Both boys established in household
**Significance:**
- Shows Dad's need for escape (parallel to Derrick's Aunt Mae refuge)
- Shows Mom's control extends even to Dad's spaces
- Family system dynamics visible early

**Implication:**
- Chronologically belongs in Chapter 3 timeframe (ages 5-10)
- Could belong in Chapter 6 (Dave's arrival)
- Currently duplicated in Ch 3 (finalized) and Ch 7 (Google Doc)

### 3. Boys Town Timing (Age 12-13)

**When:** 1976-1977, summer after group home threat
**Context:** Age 12-13, pre-teen tensions
**Significance:**
- Adoption anxiety
- Comes AFTER years of established brotherhood
- Comes AFTER group home threat (context matters)
- 5+ years AFTER Aunt Mae visits stopped

**Implication:**
- Does NOT belong in Chapter 3 (ages 5-10)
- MUST stay in Chapter 7 (ages 12-13)
- Pulling it forward to Ch 3 creates massive chronology error

## Decision Matrix: Where Should Each Scene Live?

### Scene 1: Dad's Bowling Alley (Age 7-8)

**Current Status:** Duplicated in Ch 3 (finalized) and Ch 7 (Google Doc)

**Option A: Keep in Chapter 3 ONLY**
- ✓ Chronologically correct (age 7-8)
- ✓ Shows family dynamics during Aunt Mae years
- ✓ Parallels Derrick's escape (Aunt Mae) with Dad's (bowling)
- ✓ Integrated with Dave's introduction to family
- ✗ Makes Chapter 3 longer

**Option B: Keep in Chapter 7 ONLY**
- ✓ Groups all "family tensions" content together
- ✓ Keeps Chapter 3 focused on Aunt Mae
- ✗ Chronologically out of order (if placed after ages 9-10 content)
- ✗ Would need reordering to put it first

**Option C: Keep in Chapter 6**
- ✓ Right after Dave's arrival
- ✓ Shows immediate family dynamics
- ✗ Chapter 6 already has clear arc (Dave's arrival)

**RECOMMENDATION:** **Option A** - Keep in Chapter 3, delete from Chapter 7
- Chronologically accurate
- Thematically fits (refuge/escape theme)
- Shows family system during same period as Aunt Mae visits

---

### Scene 2: Dave at Aunt Mae's (Ages 7-10)

**Current Status:** In finalized Chapter 3, NOT in Google Doc chapters

**Decision:** ✓ **KEEP in Chapter 3**
- Chronologically correct (ages 7-10)
- Essential for through-line (unconditional love is universal)
- Shows Aunt Mae's character
- Prevents reader thinking "she just liked Derrick better"

---

### Scene 3: Boys Town (Age 12-13)

**Current Status:** In finalized Ch 3 AND Google Doc Ch 7

**Decision:** ❌ **REMOVE from Chapter 3, KEEP in Chapter 7**
- Chronologically belongs at age 12-13
- Context requires group home threat first
- 5+ years after Aunt Mae period ended
- Massive time jump if kept in Ch 3

---

- ✓ Dave introduced to Aunt Mae (ages 7-10)
- ✓ Ice cream, church, Uncle John
- ✓ "And here's my other Shug!"
- ✓ **Dad's bowling alley (age 7-8)** ← Shows family dynamics during this period

---

### Chapter 7: "Two Different Boys" (Ages 7-13)
