Chapter 27: Holding On
With Marcia's death, my last parental tether to humanity, with all its messy, corporeal connections, was permanently severed. The number of people with firsthand knowledge of my claim to belonging in human society was dwindling. I had braced myself for the loss of parents, but no amount of preparation softened the impending loss of Jala.
The Pattern of Crisis and Recovery
After watching her survive multiple heart attacks, battle pneumonia, and live with chronic, unmanaged diabetes, I knew her time was limited. Jala had had stents placed before. She had advanced cardiovascular disease. Each crisis followed the same pattern: the urgent phone call, the flight to Charlotte, the hospital room where I'd find her connected to machines but still fighting.
I'd been here before—twice. Years ago when she was in the ICU, unable to breathe without a ventilator. Another time, when she faced major surgery.
Both times, she had looked me in the eye and said, "Derrick, I'll be okay."
And I'd answer, "Yes, Jala. You will. I got you."
But I never knew if it would be true. She was a cat with nine lives—and I had no idea how many were left.
The Quintuple Bypass Surgery
"Hi Derrick, I got the results of my angiogram," Jala announced. "I need bypass surgery for my blocked arteries."
"How blocked are they and how many?"
"Five are blocked. A few are 95% occluded, so I need the surgery now. I am scheduled for next week. Can you come?"
"Of course I can."
I arrived before the surgery. I could not tell that Jala was so compromised, but she said that she could not walk 50 feet without gasping for air.
Gina was with me. When we arrived at Novant Presbyterian Hospital, Jala already had a room. This wasn't her first time here. She'd had stents placed before - her advanced cardiovascular disease had been a shadow over our family for years. But five blocked arteries, some 95% occluded, meant we'd moved beyond the minimally invasive procedures into major surgery territory.
"Hi Jala!" I said as we entered her room.
"Hey Derrick, I am so glad to see you man," she said, choking back tears. "I missed you."
How long had it been since I had seen her? I can't remember. Years of phone calls about doctor visits, medication adjustments, insurance battles - but when was the last time I'd actually been present? And this may be the last time. My heart raced.
"I am here Jala," I said, when I really meant "I am so sorry that I have been such a bad brother."
When I looked at her more closely, I noticed something that broke my heart - Jala had cut her hair to appear to be a man. She was concerned that if she died, that she would not be accepted by God as a woman. Seeing her beautiful hair shorn away, watching her trying to present as Dave again after years of living authentically as Jala, felt like witnessing someone preparing to deny herself even in death.
Josh, Gina, Jala, and I discussed her wishes: how she wanted her funeral to go, who to contact, what name to use on any paperwork. The conversation felt surreal - here was this vibrant person I loved, planning her own memorial service while wearing a hospital gown with cartoon bears on it.
It went in one ear and out the other. Jala would be ok. Uncle Bubba had had quadruple bypass surgery and lived another 30 years. Technology was better now. Surely Jala would be ok.
But even as I dismissed her fears, something about the hair haunted me. How much internal torment had led to that decision? How much fear about divine acceptance had she carried alone? While I'd been living my comfortable life in California, she'd been wrestling not just with physical illness but spiritual terror about her very identity.
The surgery would take hours. While we waited, we left to eat with Josh and help him navigate what would become his new routine.
At twenty-five, Josh was old enough to manage on his own, but living in their shared apartment, he'd relied on Jala for transportation and emotional support. Now, with her facing weeks of recovery, he'd need to handle everything alone - work, hospital visits, and caring for the parent who had always been his anchor.
We drove him to the grocery store first. Watching him carefully count bills and select the cheapest options reminded me of Jala's financial struggles. While I lived comfortably in California, they scraped by on her disability payments and whatever Josh could earn at his job.
"How much does the bus cost?" Josh asked as we mapped out the route from their apartment to the hospital.
"Two dollars each way," I said, realizing that four dollars a day for hospital visits could strain their already tight budget. I pressed a twenty into his hand. "For bus fare."
The route we traced on paper - three transfers, an hour each way - would become Josh's lifeline to his only parent for the next month. As we drove the route once to show him the stops, I felt the weight of how precarious their life was. One surgery had turned a twenty-five-year-old into the primary caregiver, managing medical visits, work schedules, and survival on limited resources.
When we returned to the hospital, Jala was still in surgery.
The Years Between
The years that followed brought a predictable cycle of crisis and recovery, each one leaving Jala a little weaker, me a little more aware of how precious our time together was. She survived the quintuple bypass, but it marked the beginning of a steeper decline.
I had tried everything to help with what became her most dangerous enemy: diabetes. I'd worked for a nonprofit that helped people manage diabetes, learned of the techniques and technologies, and been coached on how to battle diabetes successfully by my friend Steve Van.
I begged her to eat better. I suggested a continuous glucose monitor so she could see, in real time, what certain foods were doing to her body. But Jala lived on permanent disability and rent assistance I provided. She could not afford the glucose monitor. And the cheapest food is always the worst—high in salt and sugar, low in everything else.
She'd been living with uncontrolled diabetes for years. Her vision was failing, her feet had gone numb, and she'd once crashed her car into her apartment's wooden stairwell because she couldn't feel the pedals. Her kidneys were failing. Dialysis every two or three days was the only thing keeping toxins from building up and killing her.
Joshua's Bond
To Joshua, Jala wasn't just a parent—she was his protector, his motivator, the one who had shared an apartment with him for much of the past three years. Their bond was fierce and complicated in the way that only parent-child relationships can be. Jala pushed Joshua to complete his education, and failing that, to get a job.
Her son had recently moved to Richmond, Virginia. Her only consistent companion now was Sasha, her dog.
Maya's Wedding: A Rally
Yet, six years later in 2022, Jala surprised us all.
She rallied to attend my daughter Maya's wedding in Jamaica. Her flight was delayed, which nearly pushed her anxiety to a breaking point. She even considered turning back. But the thought of missing her niece's wedding and the chance to see family kept her moving forward. When the shuttle finally dropped her off at our villa, she looked completely worn, makeup smudged, sweat pouring down her brow in the humid Jamaican sun, wearing shoes that were barely fit for donation. But she had made it, with just a few hours to spare.
Gina helped Jala prepare for the wedding. An hour later, showered, shaved, and dressed in a knee-length hot pink dress with flat shoes because heels would be impossible with her neuropathy, Jala emerged to join us for the ride to the wedding hall. Her presence was all the more remarkable given the twenty guests who couldn't attend, including my two half-sisters from New York, due to an unanticipated Jamaican air traffic controllers' strike. Those who did make it shared in a truly magical celebration.
After the wedding, Jala joined us for a night at a traditional British-style inn. Our rooms were on the second floor, with no elevator. I took her bag and started up the stairs, but when I turned back, it was clear she was struggling to breathe. Gina and I exchanged a look that said everything—Jala couldn't make it up the stairs.
We quickly arranged a pair of ground-floor rooms, and Gina and I shared a tearful acknowledgment of the seriousness of Jala's condition. When she returned to the United States the next day, we insisted she see her cardiologist. It turned out that Jala had suffered another heart attack while trying to climb those stairs.
A Difficult Thanksgiving
Six months later, on Thanksgiving Day 2022, a phone call shattered whatever peace the holiday promised. Jala had been hospitalized, immobilized by excruciating back pain. Tests revealed sepsis. The infection from her dialysis port that she had battled for weeks had spread to her spine.
I booked the next flight.
At Novant Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte, I found her awake but heavily medicated. Stubble shadowed her jaw and upper lip. Her once-vibrant curls were matted and dull. Sweat beaded on her brow.
This time felt different.
When I walked into the room, her face lit up through the haze of pain.
"Derrick! I'm so glad you're here," she said, tears welling in her eyes.
"I can't walk," she confessed. Her voice was heavy with fear and exhaustion.
The infection had invaded her spine and spinal cord, causing weakness in her legs. The doctors recommended surgery to clear the infection. There were no guarantees. The alternative? Certain paralysis. Loss of bowel and bladder control. Dependence.
"I want to come stay with you in California," she said. "I can't live in a nursing home. Not alone."
"I understand, Jala. I got you. Don't worry about that," I said.
But I didn't say yes. I couldn't—not yet. The responsibility scared me. But this wasn't the time for hesitation, and she knew it.
"Okay, Derrick," she said quietly.
"Let's focus on getting you healthy," I offered.
She nodded, then paused.
"Can you help me shave? I don't like looking like this. I already had to correct a nurse who called me 'sir.'"
"Of course."
I got a razor and shaving cream from the nurse's station and gently shaved her, one careful stroke at a time—helping her reclaim a piece of dignity, a piece of herself, in a place that had taken so much.
The Surgery
The next day, Jala chose to have the surgery.
When I saw her stable afterward, I returned home, clinging to hope.
But hope didn't hold. The surgery failed.
When I flew back to Charlotte days later, her eyes told me everything before she spoke.
"Derrick," she said, her voice hollow, "I can't feel my legs. I can't live like this."
"I know, Jala. I understand."
I had tried for years to get her to stop driving after multiple accidents—neuropathy and near-blindness had made it reckless—but she'd refused. She wasn't one to give up.
Until now.
