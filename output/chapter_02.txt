Chapter 2: The Perfect Shot

Preparation

"Derrick, go downstairs and get your graduation gown from the ironing
board," Mom called from the kitchen.

I ran down to the basement and saw Daddy had his camera bag opened on
the ping-pong table, checking his equipment.

"Hi Daddy!"

"Hey Bolo!"

"Howard, it is time to go!" Mom shouted from upstairs.

We both rushed up to the kitchen.

The white graduation gown was just a bit too long, pooling around my
feet like a miniature wedding dress. I didn't understand why I was
wearing this long dress or why I had to wear a cap. What did it mean to
"graduate"?

"Stand still, Derrick," Mom said, kneeling to pin up the hem with quick,
efficient movements. "I need to fix this before the ceremony."

As we drove over, Mom instructed: "Derrick, you need to act right.
Smile! Walk straight. Don't talk unless spoken to by an adult.
Understand?" "Yes ma'am." I dutifully responded.

Soon we were back in that familiar basement. Vernon Chapel AME Church
occupied a corner on Norfolk, just a few blocks away on the other side
of Ryan Road, the kind of place where Rev. Brockington could walk to
work from his house five doors down from ours, where everyone knew which
families sat in which pews. Mom had chosen it not for God, but for
convenience. But we went to Metropolitan Church on Sundays, so I did not
know these people.

Every day for a whole year, I came to this basement and lay down on the
blue cots that smelled like pee. I would close my eyes and wait,
listening for Mom's footsteps on the stairs. The other kids played
together, but they never asked me to play. I wanted to go home where I
could read my books and show Momma how smart I was.

Here, we just recited along with the teacher, "A is for Apple" while
staring at the big red apple on the wall. I already knew all my letters
and could read. The drills bored me.

Today the basement was crowded with parents, and it smelled
different—like the perfume Mom wore to church mixed with coffee.
Something was finally happening, though I didn't yet understand I was
about to give my first real performance.

Graduation

My church shoes squeaked on the vinyl tile as our teacher moved us
around like dolls. "Stand here. Move there. Shortest to tallest." She
spaced us out with her hands, measuring the gaps between us. I stood
where she put me, trying not to move. The basement was hot and smelled
like Pine-Sol mixed with that musty smell. My house never smelled like
that.

Looking at the other children lined up beside me, I noticed something
I'd seen before but never really thought about: the other kids looked
more like Mom and Daddy than I did—their eyes were brown like Mom's,
hair curly like Daddy's.

I could see Daddy in the back, with his camera in hand.

Mom sat with the other parents, and I could see her watching me. When
the pianist played "Pomp and Circumstance" on the old upright piano, I
remembered to smile big, just like I did every time Daddy raised his
camera. I wanted to make sure Mom could see I was being good.

As the teacher called our names, an assistant passed out our diplomas.

"Hold this up in front of you," she whispered.

As we stood up waiting for our names to be called, I realized I needed
to pee. Mom would be angry if I asked to pee now.

When my name was called, "Derrick Raynard Burns," I walked across the
small stage to get my diploma, making sure to stand up straight like Mom
always told me. I could see Daddy walking down the center aisle to get
closer to the stage.

Daddy was ready, positioned perfectly at the front. I could see him in
my peripheral vision, camera raised, waiting for the exact moment. As
the teacher placed the diploma in my hands, the light of his flash
blinded me for a second. Not now Derrick. Smile. Smile.

From the front row, Mom's smile was bigger than I'd ever seen it. That
made me happy. Daddy's face was mostly hidden behind the camera.

"Congratulations, Derrick!"

"He's reading already," one mother said, shaking her head in amazement.
"Willa, you're doing such a wonderful job with him!"

Mom beamed.

"Can I have another cookie, Mom?" I asked.

"Just one more," she allowed, then called across the room. "Howard! One
more picture. Get Derrick holding his diploma by himself."

I straightened my cap and held up my certificate. I knew this was
important.

Back Home

"Mom, can we look at my baby book?" I asked, after dinner.

"Yes, dear. Howard…" she said, commanding Daddy to get the book.

Daddy sat up on the bed, holding the big orange baby book in his lap. I
climbed up between Mom and Daddy and leaned on Daddy's right arm. I
liked looking at the pictures. The best ones from Daddy's camera always
ended up here.

I pointed to the photograph of Mom and Daddy standing with a woman in a
dark dress outside a big brick building.

"That's me?" I asked.

"Yes, sweetie, and Mrs. Ricks. That's her with Momma's baby!" Mom said
proudly.

Each time I see this picture, I stare at her. Who is she? Why is she
holding me? She does not come to visit like Mom and Daddy's other
friends. And, they always call her "Mrs. Ricks," no first names.

"She helped us to find you," Mom explained.

That night, after Mom tucked me into my twin bed, I pulled the covers
back and got on my hands and knees and rocked back and forth. I rocked
and I rocked, until exhausted, I buried my head in the pillow and fell
asleep.

The Report

6-26-64:

[The] Worker called at 18414 Shields in the mid A.M. at the Burns home.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Burns, and baby Ricky, at home. Mr. Burns was enjoying
a week’s vacation to get better acquainted with his son. Ricky was
sleeping but soon awakened. He is indeed a happy, smiling baby. It was
noted [that] his skin tone and features match Mr. Burn’s very well…

His nursery was spotless, airy, and most attractive with deep blue
organdy tier curtains on the extensive window areas on two walls against
the painted walls, which are white. Above his crib was hung a colorful
plaque painted by the art teacher in the school Mrs. Burns has taught
in, with the memo “Congratulations to Derrick Raynard Burns for getting
such wonderful parents”. Mrs. Burns plans to have this framed. Ricky has
sufficient current visual hunger to enjoy the bright colors in this
plaque.

Mr. Burns reveals his pride and joy in his son, explaining he matches
and fits so well in their way of life that even friends find it hard to
believe he is not their biological child.

Mrs. Burns, in her quiet, refined manner seems to be basking in the
compensations of her long-time planning for a child. With the evidence
of baby furniture, equipment for baby’s comfort and needs everywhere
about the home, one readily places this household as a child-centered
family. Mrs. Burns proudly showed many colored pictures and snapshots,
and gave [the] worker two [of them] for [the] office displayboard.
