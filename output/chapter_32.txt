Chapter 32: The Triumph

The squeak of my sneakers against the court felt foreign after months
away. My first step back onto the YMCA basketball court in March 2024
carried more weight than just physical movement - it was a declaration
of life. The familiar smell of rubber and sweat mixed with the sound of
bouncing balls, a symphony I'd missed during my months of treatment.

"Man, you're moving better than you have in years!" Denis called out,
his voice carrying across the court.

"You move like you are twenty years younger!"

The words hit differently than the usual trash talk. He was right - my
lateral movement felt explosive, my defensive slides smoother. The
chemotherapy weight loss had stripped away years of accumulated bulk,
leaving me lighter, quicker.

But recovery came with its own rhythm, two steps forward, one step back.
My beloved three-point shot abandoned me - the muscle memory was there
but the strength wasn't. My triceps had withered along with other
muscles I'd taken for granted. Each attempt fell short, a humbling
reminder of the work ahead.

"It'll come back," Armando assured me, his voice carrying the weight of
thirty years watching players recover from injuries.

"Just keep shooting."

The physical transformation was stark - forty-two pounds lighter, I
caught glimpses of my reflection in the gym mirrors and barely
recognized myself. My new Zara wardrobe replaced the baggy Costco
clothes that hung like tents on my transformed frame. "Zara
Distinguished," I dubbed my new style, taking pride in wearing clothes
targeted for young, fashion-conscious customers. I even befriended the
Costco return agents as I unloaded 10 years of clothing that no longer
fit, using their "unlimited" returns policy for clothing (though the
real limit is 10 years!).

But beneath the visible changes, invisible battles continued. As my
oncologist had warned, "radiation is the gift that keeps on giving." The
muscles on the left side of my neck had become like leather, requiring
daily stretching exercises. A constant dry mouth demanded a water bottle
companion. When I walked, it felt like I had a wad of tissue under my
left foot - neuropathy, they called it. Tingling sensations shot down my
back when I bent forward. Carpal tunnel syndrome plagued my left wrist.
My quadriceps were so weak that I tore my right calf playing basketball,
twice.

The changes went deeper still. My gums no longer bled - not from
improved dental hygiene but from decreased blood flow, another subtle
reminder of the treatment's lasting impact. The skin on my neck bore a
slightly darker shade on the left side, a permanent badge of survival.
Ringing in my ears signaled mild hearing loss.

Yet these were small prices to pay. I still had my larynx, unlike my
friend Steve. The bigger threats - thyroid problems, secondary cancers,
kidney damage - remained at bay. My immune system had recovered, the
lethargy and nausea were gone, and my voice had returned to normal.

In June, Doctor Tang's office felt different. The same dark corridors
that had once filled me with dread now felt almost welcoming. As he
manipulated the scope through my nasal passage, I watched the monitor
with new understanding. "Complete response to treatment," he announced,
showing me two images side by side - my throat from diagnosis and now.

Then he shared something that stopped my breath. He pulled up the image
from my second biopsy, taken just eight days after the first. The
tumor's growth was shocking - aggressive, invasive, pressing against my
epiglottis. "It took three anesthesiologists to place your breathing
tube," he said quietly. "We were very worried." The urgency hadn't been
about my wife's status as a colleague. It had been about saving my life
from a particularly aggressive cancer that had been winning the race
against time.

This brush with mortality changed everything. I thought about Ellis's
friend's words: "Looking back, it was the best experience of my life."
At the time, they'd seemed impossible, perhaps influenced by heavy
narcotics. I understood. Cancer had given me something precious - a
second chance to connect with what mattered most.

The gift of time made me reach deeper into my past, seeking connections
I'd let fade after leaving Detroit. After Aunt Mae's death, I'd built
walls around my heart, letting childhood friendships dwindle to annual
phone calls and holiday greetings. Now, those walls felt as unnecessary
as my old, oversized clothes.

I started first by researching friends and teachers online.

Doctor James Allen Jones, who opened my eyes to me living in a bigger
world, had died. His obituary said that he had earned a Fulbright
Scholarship in 1957, over a decade before I had the good fortune of
being his world geography and drama student!

All but one of my high school teachers had died, as had Mrs. Voss who
was killed in a car accident by a man fleeing the police. I needed a
connection to someone living!

"JIMMY!" I called one afternoon, my voice carrying the same excitement
it had in high school.

"D. BURNS!" he responded instantly, decades melting away in those two
words.

Jimmy knew me before the masks, before the performances. He knew my
parents when they were healthy, knew Dave before the transition to Jala,
knew me when tears flowed freely down my cheeks. Our conversations, once
confined to birthdays and holidays, now spilled into marathon phone
calls two or three times a week. The timing was perfect - his kids were
out of college, his wife back at work, and both of us ready to reclaim
the brotherhood we'd let slip away.

Between basketball games at the Y, I'd sit in my car, phone pressed to
my ear, sharing my cancer journey with Jimmy. His responses carried the
weight of shared history - he understood not just what I was saying, but
what it meant in the context of who I'd always been. The boy who'd
hidden his feelings behind achievement was finally learning to be
vulnerable.

The reconnection spread like ripples in a pond. Jim, my sister-cousins,
Ron, and Bill - each relationship rekindled with new depth. They were
the family I'd chosen, and though distance had created gaps, the
foundation had never truly crumbled.

But time doesn't pause for healing. One morning, as I was planning my
next round of calls, my phone rang.

"Derrick, this is Dennis, Glenn's brother."

My heart tightened before he even said the words.

"I have some bad news. Glenn died a few days ago. We found him in his
home."

"Had he been sick?" I managed to ask.

"No!" Dennis's shock matched my own.

The memories flooded back - Big Glenn, our neighborhood leader, packing
us into his Deuce and a Quarter on Friday nights, my mom's Bonneville
following close behind as we roamed from party to party. His voice, soft
and slow, making the hard decisions we needed to hear:

"Yo Fellas. We can't hang out anymore," he'd pronounced after bullets
flew too close one night.

We'd felt invincible together, but Glenn's wisdom had probably saved our
lives.

The timing felt cruel. Just months earlier, I'd helped bridge one final
gap for Glenn. He and Jala had grown apart - Glenn wanting Dave, not
accepting Jala. The day before Jala died, I'd made the call.

"Glenn, this is Derrick."

"Hey Derrick, it is good to hear from you," that familiar drawl warming
the line.

"Yeah man, it has been far too long." My voice cracked.

"I have some bad news buddy. Dave is dying. She goes as Jala now, as I
think you know. One of the heaviest weights on her heart is the loss of
friendship with you. Could you talk to her for a few minutes to give her
some comfort?"

"Sure Derrick. I don't have any hard feelings for Dave... err Jala."

When I told Jala that Glenn was on the phone, her eyes lit up through
tears. The call was brief, but I watched years of pain flow down her
cheeks - grief for lost time, joy for this moment of reconnection.

Now, just months after losing Jala, Glenn was gone too. When Dennis
tried to comfort me, saying Glenn had lived a good life, I understood
something deeper about time and connection. The physical scars from
cancer would fade, but its greatest gift was this urgency to reconnect,
to heal old wounds, to say the words that matter while there's still
time.

Back on the basketball court, I catch glimpses of who we all used to
be - young, strong, believing we had all the time in the world. My
three-point shot is slowly returning, but the real victory isn't in the
baskets made. It's in understanding that every squeak of these sneakers,
every conversation with old friends, every moment of connection is
precious. Cancer didn't just change my body - it changed how I move
through time itself, teaching me to value not just the big moments, but
all the small ones that make a life complete.
