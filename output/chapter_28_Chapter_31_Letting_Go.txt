Chapter 28: Letting Go
"I think I'm going to stop dialysis," she said.
We both knew what that meant. Stopping meant death. No ambiguity.
"But I need to know something first," she said, her voice trembling. "Will God still accept me in heaven?"
Her eyes—usually clear, confident, full of fire—were now clouded with fear. Life had often been cruel, but eternity? That was something else. That was permanent.
"Why wouldn't He, Jala? You're one of the kindest, most godly people I know," I said, trying to pull her back from that edge—trying to convince her, and maybe myself, that she was worthy.
"I need to know it's not suicide. And I need to know if my gender… if that's a problem."
And there it was.
She wasn't just preparing to die. She was seeking divine permission to let go.
We'd both been raised in church, but we didn't know the scriptures like that. Still, we clung to the God we believed in—the one who loved boundlessly.
"No God we were taught to believe in would reject you, Jala."
She looked away.
"Yeah…" she said, softly. Not quite believing.
Facing Mortality and Faith
As Jala's condition declined, she turned to me one afternoon and said, "I need your help planning my funeral."
She was still Jala—organized, clear-headed, a planner to the end. She already had everything mapped out in her mind. I took notes as she spoke: donate her body to science, invite the labor leaders and local politicians she had championed, and ask Reverend Doctor William J. Barber II to preside.
I hadn't realized how deep her connection to Doctor Barber ran—until she handed me his private number and said, "Call him."
When he answered, she didn't hesitate.
"Bishop Barber," she asked, "will I go to hell for being transgender?"
There was a pause. Then his voice came through—measured, grounded in scripture.
He quoted Matthew 19:12:
"For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."
He went on to reference the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8:26–40—a figure welcomed into the faith, baptized without hesitation. Jala listened intently, her eyes wet but steady.
Reassured, she asked her next question.
"Bishop Barber, will I go to hell for stopping dialysis?"
His response was gentle but firm.
"No, Jade," he said, using her chosen name for her public advocacy persona, Jade X Jackson.
"You have served the Lord your God with all your heart and soul. Your body is tired. God is ready for you."
A long silence followed. Not uncomfortable—just full.
Then Jala made her final request.
"Doctor Barber, will you preside over my funeral?"
He didn't hesitate.
"Yes," he said.
As Jala thanked Doctor Barber and hung up the phone, I sat back and marvelled at the beautiful person that I had the honor of calling my sister.
One More Thing
With her funeral program set and having received permission to "let go and let God" as my mother would say, Jala seemed nearly content.
"One more thing, Derrick. Glenn has refused to speak with me since I transitioned." Jala said, tears welling up in her eyes, as my heart sank with hers.
I stepped out of the room and got Glenn's phone number from Jamie, another high school friend of Jala's.
"Glenn, this is Derrick." I announced.
"Hey Derrick, how are you doing?" he said, as if we had just spoken last week.
"Not so good man, Dave is dying" using the name that Glenn would immediately recognize.
"He – well she now – feels so bad that she hasn't spoken to you since transitioning to Jala. Will you speak with her?" I pleaded.
"Sure Derrick. I don't have any bad feelings for Jala."
I walked back into the hospital room and passed the phone to Jala. Listening to half the conversation, I witnessed years of estrangement melt away, as tears of joy streamed down both of our faces.
For the first time in days, she looked at peace.
The Final Moments
Days later, Jala was drowning. Not in water—in her own body. Her lungs heavy, her limbs bloated, skin stretched and tight from fluid. Her choice to stop dialysis was killing her. Slowly. Brutally.
Death by kidney failure isn't peaceful. It's gasping, choking, swelling, suffocating. But the hospital did what it could—morphine, silence, dim lights.
It wasn't enough.
Her eyes locked on mine—pleading, terrified. Her chest heaved like it was lifting a mountain with every breath. Each time she inhaled, it shattered me.
I leaned in close, cradling her head like something sacred, my lips at her ear.
"I got you. I'm here. I'll take care of Josh. Your job is done. You're safe now. You can rest now. I'm here."
Her breathing turned frantic. Wild. She thrashed, eyes wide.
"Help me… I can't… breathe—"
The nurse rushed in, injected the last dose of morphine. Then she turned to me, quiet and tense.
"I can't give her anything more," she said. "But… if she enters hospice care, the nurses there can do more."
More.
What the hell was more?
I looked down at Jala, at the woman who'd survived so much already. Who kept going when her body screamed no.
"Jala," I said. "It's time. Hospice. Are you ready?"
Her eyes softened. "Yes, Derrick. I'm ready."
The nurse left to enter the orders. Minutes later, she returned.
"Hospice is on this floor," she said. "We'll wheel her down the hall."
We moved as one—me, Gina, Maya, Jamil, Joshua—hands on the bed, hearts in our throats. As we walked, I looked into the rooms we passed. Patients alone in their beds, rooms quiet, just… waiting to die.
That would not be Jala.
Not like my father.
Not like my mother.
Not without us.
In the hospice room, a new nurse came in. She carried a syringe and a calm voice.
"This will help ease her suffering."
I glanced at the monitor. She was confirming the med—Dilaudid.
I knew that drug.
I'd had it once for kidney stones. Killed the pain, instantly. But the dose had been too strong. I hadn't passed out—but I stopped breathing.
I turned to Jala just as the nurse pushed the plunger.
Then I looked at the screen.
Dilaudid dispensed.
When I turned back, everything had changed.
The fight was gone.
No more gasping. No more panic.
She breathed in—slow, full.
Then out.
And that was it.
Her last breath.
Gina had seen it coming. She knew. After thirty years of marriage and countless conversations about medical situations, I could practically be a triage nurse—but I was still one step behind.
I had told our kids the night before. I had prepared them. We were here to say goodbye.
But Joshua? I couldn't bring myself to say the words. How do you tell a child his father is dying?
Because that's what Jala had been to him—father, protector, anchor.
He had seen her suffer before. Struggle and survive. Jala had always survived. Every time.
"Wake up! Wake up!" Joshua screamed.
"You can't leave me! I need you! Wake up!"
And for the next hour, we held him—while he screamed the things the rest of us were too shattered to say. Later, when his voice gave out and exhaustion took over, we sat together in that sacred silence, learning that sometimes love means simply bearing witness to unbearable loss.
