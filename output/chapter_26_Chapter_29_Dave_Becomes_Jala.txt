Chapter 26: Dave Becomes Jala
In stark contrast to my turbulent relationship with Marcia, my bond with Dave was rock solid. He was my constant. What I didn't yet understand was that Dave's steadiness in our relationship masked profound internal turbulence in his own life.
After I left for college, Dave stayed behind in Detroit to finish his degree at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. We didn't talk as much during that time, and when we did, our conversations were light—updates on our old neighborhood friend Glenn Burch, small things that had a grounding quality, like holding onto pieces of home that hadn't changed.
Glenn was like an older brother to both of us. He went on to play football at the University of Toledo and even had a shot at going pro. After college, he bought a home back in Detroit but commuted to Toledo for work—a 60-mile drive each way—until he retired in 2018. Glenn was steady, dependable, always there. But eventually, things started to shift.
Dave's Inner Turmoil
Dave met his best friend and future wife, Renee, at Eastern. Together, they had a son and eventually moved to North Carolina, where they spent the next ten years building a life. But beneath that surface stability, Dave was wrestling with something profound and deeply personal.
I always sensed that something wasn't quite right. Dad's pictures rarely showed Dave smiling. I, on the other hand, always smiled—just as Mom had taught me. But Dave? I could never tell if he was unwilling or simply unable.
I got my answer a decade later.
The truth was, Dave didn't feel like Dave. Inside, he didn't feel like a man at all. Eventually, Dave came out as transgender and embraced her true self, legally changing her name to Jala Alyshia McKenzie-Burns.
The Revelation
Dave and I had not talked in several weeks and I was ashamed that I had not called. So I picked up the phone.
"Hey Dave, how are you doing?" I said, trying to sound casual despite the guilt gnawing at me.
"Hi Derrick. I'm good. Actually, I'm really good." Something in his voice was different - lighter somehow, but also nervous. "Derrick, there is something I need to tell you. This is not about you. You have always been my hero, my big brother. I love you."
The careful way he said it made my stomach tighten. When someone starts with "this is not about you," it usually means it's going to feel like it's about you.
"Okay..." I said, settling back in my chair, phone pressed closer to my ear.
"Derrick, I have always known that I don't feel right in this body. I remember when I was with Mrs. Williams. They made me dress up in girls' clothes and dance."
"What?" I asked, my voice sharper than I intended. Mrs. Williams - that name from Dave's early childhood that he rarely mentioned.
"Yes, but the thing is Derrick. I am a girl inside. I started to dress like a woman in my apartment. When Paris and I go out to the mall, I dress as a woman. I am not doing it at work yet, but I will soon."
"Do you feel better?"
"Oh yes. I picked a new name too. Jala. Jala Mackenzie Burns. I did not want to change my last name. That would disrespect Dad."
"Wow. I don't know what to say."
My mind scrambled to make sense of what I'd just heard. Dave... Jala? I thought about all those years of shared bedrooms, of calling him "man" and "dude." Had I been hurting him this whole time without knowing? The protectiveness I'd always felt surged, but now I didn't know what I was protecting him from - or how.
"Well Jala, I love you, unconditionally. I did not know about your feelings. I... I don't really know what to say other than that. I am here for you, but it may take me a while to get used to this man." As I made my first mis-gendering mistake.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. Not angry, just... waiting.
"Sorry," I said quickly. "I mean... I need time to get used to this. But I love you." The word "unconditionally" felt important to repeat, like an anchor in suddenly shifting waters.
"I know, Derrick. Thank you for saying that. It means everything." Her voice was softer now, relieved. "I know it's a lot."
"Yeah, it is," I admitted. "But we're family. We figure it out together, right?"
"Right."
After we hung up, I sat staring at the phone for I don't know how long. Twenty-five years of calling someone "Dave," "man," "dude" - all those casual greetings that now felt wrong. I thought about all the times I might have missed signals, moments when Dave had seemed distant or sad that I'd attributed to other things.
I picked up the phone twice to call back with questions, then set it down. What would I even ask? This wasn't about my understanding. This was about her courage to finally tell me who she'd always been.
But one thought kept circling: If Dave had known since childhood, how had I missed it? What kind of brother was I?
Learning the New Language
"Derrick, call me Jala. I am not Dave," Jala said during one of our early conversations after her revelation.
I did not know what that meant. My brother was... what? In front of me? Dead? Gone?
When I mistakenly used the wrong pronouns, Jala immediately and forcefully corrected me. I often slipped, calling her "man" or saying things like, "yes sir" and "Dude, really," out of old habit. These unintentional slips hurt her feelings in the early years, but I asked for and received her forgiveness. It took time to unlearn twenty-five years of ingrained greetings, but I was determined to honor who she truly was.
Beyond pronouns, I had to examine my own assumptions about gender and identity. Watching Jala live her truth taught me that authenticity isn't just brave—it's essential. She wasn't becoming someone different; she was finally becoming herself.
The First California Visit
When Jala stepped off the plane at SFO in 2011, there was no mistaking her intent. Hot pink slippers caught the terminal's fluorescent light, and her frilly top announced to anyone within fifty yards: I am a woman, and I will not be invisible.
"Derrick!" she called, her voice carrying that familiar warmth but with a new confidence I'd never heard before.
As we embraced in the bustling terminal, I felt the curious stares of other travelers, but Jala seemed oblivious to them. Here in California, three thousand miles from Detroit's watchful eyes, she wasn't performing femininity—she was celebrating it.
During the drive home, she chattered excitedly about the flight, the view from the plane, how different everything looked. But as we pulled into my driveway, I noticed her fidgeting with her top, smoothing it down.
"They know, right?" she asked suddenly. "Maya and Jamil? You told them?"
"They know," I assured her. "And they're excited to see you."
When we walked through the front door, the welcomes came immediately.
"Aunt Jala!" Maya rushed forward, seventeen and unafraid, wrapping her newly-out aunt in a hug that lasted long enough to matter.
"Oh sweetie," Jala responded, the endearment flowing naturally, "look how beautiful you are!"
Jamil, nineteen and typically reserved, stepped forward without hesitation. "Hey Aunt Jala."
"Hello, dear," she said, her eyes misting slightly.
Gina approached last, her smile genuine and warm—not the careful, supportive smile she'd worn during difficult family moments, but real delight. "Welcome to California," she said, embracing Jala. "We're so glad you're here."
The casual acceptance from my family—no awkwardness, no questions, just family being family—seemed to overwhelm her. I watched her shoulders relax, saw her settle into herself in a way I'd never witnessed before.
That week, I became Jala's personal tour guide, driven by a desperate need to compress years of missed connection into seven days. We climbed the three hundred steps to Coit Tower, her pink slippers somehow managing the concrete stairs while she paused every fifty steps to catch her breath, not from exertion but from the view.
"Honey, this is gorgeous," she said, looking out over the San Francisco Bay. "I can see why you love it here."
In Napa, at Silverado Winery, we walked around the enormous estate, two stories over the sprawling hills of grape vines. Watching her take in the vast landscape—confident, engaging, authentically herself—I realized something profound: Jala hadn't just changed her appearance. She'd found her voice.
On the coast near Half Moon Bay, we walked along the beach in comfortable silence, her frilly top catching the ocean breeze. The Pacific stretched endless before us, and I found myself thinking about all the Sunday phone calls I'd cut short, all the visits I'd postponed, all the time I'd let slip away while she struggled alone with the biggest transformation of her life.
"I'm sorry," I said suddenly.
She turned, confused. "For what, Derrick?"
"For not being there. For not visiting more. For letting work and distance become excuses."
Jala stopped walking and faced me fully, her expression soft but firm. "Derrick, you have always been there for me," she said, embracing a lie that was the foundation of her sense of security. I was her rock, no matter what I did.
The words hit me like a wave. Here I was, drowning in guilt over my absence, and she was rewriting history to protect both of us. In that moment, I understood something profound about love—sometimes it requires us to hold space for the stories people need to tell themselves to survive.
I could have corrected her, listed all the ways I'd fallen short, all the calls I'd missed, all the times I'd chosen my own comfort over her needs. But looking at her face, radiant with the simple joy of having her big brother acknowledge her as she truly was, I realized that argument wasn't about facts—it was about faith.
Jala needed me to be her constant, her north star. And maybe, in the ways that mattered most, I had been. Not perfect, not always present, but ultimately, inevitably there when she needed me to see her.
"I love you, Jala," I said simply.
"I love you too, dear," she replied, and we stood there together on that California beach, brother and sister, holding onto the story that let us both forgive the imperfections of love.
The hot pink slippers were getting sandy, but neither of us moved to head back to the car. Sometimes the most important conversations happen in the spaces between what we say and what we choose not to correct.
Finding Her Voice
Over the months that followed, as I learned to see Jala for who she truly was, I also began to understand the remarkable person she'd always been beneath the surface.
Jala was a natural salesperson—the region's best closer month after month. Her gift wasn't technique; it was her deep caring heart. She genuinely cared about people, and the way she looked into customers' eyes conveyed it immediately.
At the time, I didn't fully grasp the importance of her work; I naively saw retail sales as a job for the uneducated. But what I failed to understand then was how meaningful Jala's connection with people really was.
Her true calling was community organizing. Through the Poor People's Campaign led by Rev. Doctor William J. Barber, she found a platform for her instinct to protect and uplift others. Her ability to speak truth to power, combined with her courage to live authentically, defined Jala far more than any sales numbers ever could.
Adopted by the Burns family at the age of four, Jala told me that she realized her true gender was female when she was just six years old. From a young age, Jala demonstrated a remarkable empathy for others. Perhaps this was why she had such an instinctive drive to protect those around her. In her memoir, she recounts a moment that I later verified: Jala jumped into a five-on-one fight to defend a friend. Her intervention worked, and the attackers fled. She seemed compelled to stand up for others, no matter the personal risk.
Family Acceptance
While I quickly embraced Jala's new gender identity, our mother struggled. Raised in a conservative environment, Mom had difficulty understanding and accepting the transition. Her Christian upbringing taught her that there were only two sexes and three types of sexual behavior: heterosexual, homosexual, and asexual. How could she possibly grasp the idea of her son becoming her daughter? What would her friends think? Was she somehow to blame for this "confusion"?
Mom couldn't bring herself to mention Jala at all. When I would ask Mom if she had talked to Jala, she'd simply say "No."
"She is doing well," I'd add. "I talked to her last week. She asked about you."
Mom would nod but look away, as if the words themselves were too heavy to carry. It was easier for her to pretend the topic didn't exist than to navigate the complexity of what she couldn't understand.
As I watched Jala endure the pain of this silence, I found it hard to accept my mother's inability to embrace the child she had adopted and raised as her own. It was one of the few times I felt ashamed of my mother.
But over time, I realized I needed to extend her some grace. She was fallible, just like the rest of us. The problem wasn't that she didn't love Jala—she did. The real issue was that she felt she had failed her child.
Early Struggles
But Jala struggled to hold onto her own sanity. The childhood trauma and the constant worrying about not being worthy of love tormented her. But changing her name and gender was just the tip of the iceberg of grief and shame. During her first hospitalization she suffered a major depression.
"Hi Derrick" she listlessly answered when I called.
"Hi Jala" I said, struggling for the words to lift her spirits.
During her next hospitalization she claimed to be six years old, then regressed even further to claiming she was a baby, needing to wear a diaper. This time I could not even call. I had no words. I wanted to say "what the hell are you doing? You are not a baby!"
What I was afraid to say, Jala's best friend Paris actually said. "You need to stop with that bullshit and woman up!" But the journey was not that simple.
Jala later shared much of her journey in her memoir, Climbing Life's Mountains. But what I want to focus on is the part of her story that lives outside the pages of her book. Jala's path was anything but linear.
The Cost of Authenticity
One painful casualty of Jala's transition was her relationship with Glenn. Our old neighborhood friend, who had been like an older brother to both of us, cut off contact after learning about the transition. The silence stretched for years, adding another layer of loss to Jala's already complex journey.
If our own mother struggled to accept Jala's truth, perhaps Glenn's silence shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did. The rejection hurt deeply. Glenn had been family in all the ways that mattered—someone who knew us as children, who had watched us grow, who had been steady and dependable through all our changes. But this change, apparently, was too much.
As Jala settled into her authentic life in North Carolina, building community through her organizing work and finding her voice as an advocate for the poor and marginalized, she carried this loss with her. The price of living truthfully, it seemed, sometimes included saying goodbye to people you thought would love you no matter what.
But authenticity, as Jala was teaching me, wasn't about guaranteeing that everyone would understand or accept you. It was about choosing to be real, even when that choice came with a cost.
Our Love
In her memoir, Jala may have unduly lionized me, but one thing is certain: our love for each other was steadfast throughout our lives. From the start, Dave was there for me, the sibling I had asked for. It was a privilege to fulfill my role in Dave's life, and in doing so, I had the opportunity to learn and express unconditional love.
