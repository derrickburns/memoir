Chapter 7: Two Different Boys

I could feel her breath as she looked over my shoulder. Mom had walked
up behind us as we copied the letters onto huge green paper with sets of
three parallel lines, the middle one dotted.

"No, Dave. Loop the lower case 'l'. Do it again. Write five more on the
next lines!"

Two years after Dave came to live with us, Mom was beginning to
understand something that would reshape our entire family dynamic: Dave
was not going to be another Derrick.

At first, she'd approached him with the same strategies that had worked
so well with me - structured learning, high expectations, academic
focus. But where I had flourished under pressure, Dave seemed to wilt.
Where I craved her approval through achievement, Dave sought acceptance
through connection.

The Contrast

Having Dave as a permanent fixture in my life was different from our
playdates. Within weeks, the differences between us became impossible to
ignore.

I excelled at schoolwork the way plants thrive on sunlight. Homework was
a puzzle to solve, tests were competitions to win, and Mom's academic
expectations felt like challenges I was born to meet.

Dave's talents lay in the mysterious art of making friends. He could
walk into a room full of strangers and leave with three new best
friends. Where I saw potential rejection, he saw potential adventure.
Where I calculated risks, he simply jumped in.

Mom noticed everything.

As we grew older, she assigned us household chores: making our beds,
dusting the furniture, sweeping the floor, and washing the dishes.

"Derrick! These dishes are greasy!" Mom's words would pierce the kitchen
air. "How can you clean with dirty, cold dishwater? Empty it and start
again!"

I'd scrub harder, determined to get it right.

But it was Dave's inattention and struggles with her tutoring that
really set her off. My good grades would bring a smile to her face, like
sunshine breaking through clouds.

"Dave, focus!" she'd say, her teacher-voice sharp with disappointment
when he stared out the window during our kitchen table sessions.

While she never explicitly compared us, we both could hear the unspoken
question hanging in the air: "Why can't you be like Derrick?"

Those moments made my stomach twist into knots. I wanted to speak up, to
tell her how Dave could make anyone laugh, how he could turn strangers
into friends with just a smile. But the words stayed locked behind my
teeth, held there by fear of losing her approval myself.

Dad's Separate World

Every Tuesday and Wednesday evening, Dad would come home from work,
change clothes, and head out for his bowling league. It was a regular
routine - he'd always tell us exactly when he'd be back, and he was
always true to his word. But lately, I'd noticed Mom's lips pressing
into that thin line I'd learned to recognize as trouble whenever Dad
gathered his bowling shoes and headed for the door.

One evening, after Dave and I had dragged our feet getting to the dinner
table despite Mom's repeated calls, her patience finally snapped.

"Derrick! Dave! Get your coats," she said, her voice carrying an edge
that made both Dave and me look up from our homework.

"Where are we going?" I asked.

"Just get in the car," she said, clearly upset. Did we do something
wrong?

The bowling alley hit us like a wall of sound and smoke. Pins crashed,
voices boomed, and somewhere a jukebox competed with it all. My eyes
stung as Mom's fingers drummed against her purse strap, her lips pressed
into that familiar thin line. Dave pressed closer to me, overwhelmed by
the chaos of noise and cigarette smoke.

Through the haze, I spotted Dad in lanes 7 and 8, surrounded by his
bowling buddies, laughing in a way I rarely saw at home. His shoulders
were relaxed, his smile easy and genuine. This was a different version
of my father - looser, freer, unguarded.

When Mom grabbed his elbow, that smile vanished like smoke in the air.

"Howard, we need to go," Mom said, her words slicing through the noise.

"Willa, what are you doing here?" Dad's response was quiet, but there
was something underneath it I'd never heard before - embarrassment mixed
with irritation.

"It's a school night. The boys have homework."

Dave and I stood there, feeling the eyes of Dad's friends on us,
understanding without being told that we were the reason this
confrontation was happening. Dave's hand found mine, both of us sensing
we'd stumbled into adult territory where we didn't belong.

The ride home was silent, but tension crackled between my parents like
electricity before a storm. Dave stared out his window while I studied
the back of Mom's head, trying to read her mood in the set of her
shoulders.

When we got inside, Dad's voice carried an authority I'd never heard
before.

"Willa, if you don't want kids around smoking, drinking, and cursing,
don't bring them to the bowling alley."

No shouting, no argument - just facts laid bare like the pins at the end
of a lane. It was my first real glimpse of how different my parents
could be, and how Mom's control extended even into Dad's separate
spaces.

Different Standards

In the weeks that followed, the household dynamics shifted subtly. Mom's
expectations for me remained sky-high, but with Dave, she seemed to
oscillate between patience and frustration.

"Dave, how many times do I have to tell you to put your dirty clothes
down the chute?" she'd say, her voice carrying that teacher-tone that
made both of us freeze.

"Sorry, Mom," Dave would reply, genuinely apologetic but somehow
destined to forget again the next day.

Meanwhile, if I left so much as a sock on the floor, Mom's
disappointment was swift and sharp.

"Derrick, you know better than this."

I did know better. That was the problem. With knowledge came
responsibility, and with responsibility came the weight of constant
expectations. Say more about this

Summer Activities

Maybe it was this constant measuring of our different abilities against
her unchanging standards that drove Mom to structure our summer so
completely. As if enough organized activities could somehow even us out,
make us both easier to manage. Whatever her reasoning, Mom filled our
days with scheduled events - Vacation Bible School, swimming lessons,
Boy Scouts, educational field trips to the zoo and Michigan State Fair.

At the YMCA on Woodward Avenue, we learned proper swimming strokes:
freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke. The pungent smell of chlorine
turned our eyes red and made our noses burn, but Dave took to the water
like he'd been born for it.

I struggled with the rat races across the short side of the pool - dive
in, swim across, climb out, wait for the whistle, repeat until your
lungs felt ready to burst. While I calculated each stroke and worried
about technique, Dave simply enjoyed the water, laughing even when he
came in last.

"Good job, boys!" the instructor would call, but I could see Dave's
natural athleticism emerging while I remained awkwardly cerebral about
everything, even swimming.

The Threat

By the time I turned twelve, something had shifted in our house. Can you
describe the shift? The buildup of tension? How old was your Mom Im
wondering was this menopause or some underlying thing with your Dad? We
need some guidance from adult Derrick…. The final straw came on a
Tuesday evening when I was on the phone with a friend from school,
discussing a project we were working on together.

"Derrick! Get off that phone right now!" Mom's words erupted across the
room. "You've been talking for twenty minutes!"

"But Mom, we're working on—"

"I don't care what you're working on. Hang up. Now."

I mumbled an apology to my friend and hung up, my face burning with
embarrassment. But what really got to me was what happened next. Dave
had forgotten to take out the trash again, and Mom's reaction was
explosive.

"Dave! How many times do I have to tell you? You're so irresponsible!
When are you going to start paying attention?"

Watching Dave's shoulders slump, seeing him shrink under her words while
she'd just humiliated me in front of my friend for trying to do
schoolwork - something clicked inside me. I was tired of her yelling,
tired of her telling me to get off the phone, tired of her judging Dave!
Enough was enough. I may not be able to shut her up, but I could shut me
up.

So I stopped talking to her.

Not completely - I wasn't stupid enough to ignore direct questions or
refuse to answer when spoken to. But I gave her nothing more than she
demanded. One-word answers. Shrugs. The minimum required to avoid
outright defiance while making my displeasure crystal clear.

"How was school, Derrick?" "Fine." "Did you finish your homework?"
"Yes." "Do you want to tell me about your day?" "No."

It was a cold war, and I was determined to win it. I wanted to hurt her
the way she hurt Dave with her constant criticism. I wanted her to feel
what it was like to be shut out, controlled, dismissed.

After weeks of this treatment, Mom's frustration reached a breaking
point. One afternoon, she loaded Dave and me into the car without
explanation.

"Where are we going?" I asked, breaking my usual silence.

"You'll see," she said, her voice tight with anger.

We drove through unfamiliar neighborhoods until she pulled up in front
of a large home.

We walked inside, and I was struck by the huge circular staircase that
led to the second floor. A man came out to introduce himself - he knew
we were coming, which meant Mom had planned this.

"What do you do here?" Mom asked, as if she didn't already know. "What
is this place?"

"This is a group home for children who have gotten into trouble at
home," he explained, his voice matter-of-fact as he looked at Dave and
me. "Children whose parents need help managing their behavior."

"This is where children go when they can't behave at home," Mom said,
her voice cold and matter-of-fact. "If you two don't start acting right,
this is where you'll end up."

Dave's face went pale. I felt my stomach drop, but I refused to let her
see my fear.

"Do you understand me?" she demanded.

We both nodded silently.

The drive home was quiet, but the threat hung between us like smoke.
Dave's hand found mine in the back seat, both of us understanding that
Mom had just shown us exactly how conditional our place in the family
really was.

Family Trips and Tensions

The group home threat hung over our house like a storm cloud that
summer, changing the way Dave and I moved through our daily routines. We
were more careful, more compliant, but also more distant from Mom. It
was against this backdrop of uneasy peace that August brought our
biggest adventure yet - a family road trip that would take us all the
way to Los Angeles. Dad arrived home with his treasures: the AAA Triptik
and TourBook, each page a window into our upcoming journey.

"Look, Dad! This hotel has a pool!" I'd exclaim, pointing excitedly to
listings.

"How much does it cost?" he'd ask, teaching me to balance dreams with
budgets.

Dad packed the car the night before so we could leave before dawn. Dave
and I transformed the back seat into our traveling nest, pillows propped
against doors as the engine's hum lulled us into drowsiness.

But Mom had planned a detour that would change everything: Boys Town.

He Ain't Heavy

The bronze statue loomed before us under the Midwest sun, its surface
almost glowing in the heat. One boy carried another on his back, frozen
mid-step for eternity. I read the inscription carved in the stone base:
"He ain't heavy, Mister... he's m' brother!"

A little kid nearby pulled at his mother's sleeve.

"Why's that boy carrying the other one?"

"Because that's what brothers do," his mother answered. "They help each
other."

Dave's face was expressionless, almost like he was asleep except his
eyes were wide open. The statue boys stared past us toward something we
couldn't see, their faces serious like they knew something we didn't.

My pulse raced, pressure built in my chest, and a lump formed in my
throat that made it impossible to speak.

Mom rested her hand on Dave's shoulder, but I saw the slight tension in
his posture. Around us, other families snapped photos and chatted, but
as Mom encouraged us to walk around and explore, Dave and I remained
silent.

The tour guide's voice drifted across the courtyard, talking about
Father Flanagan and how Boys Town started - a place for boys who had
nowhere else to go. Boys who needed homes. Boys like... like Dave?

I couldn't meet Dave's eyes, afraid of what I might see there. Did he
think this was why we'd stopped? Did he worry that Mom and Dad were
reconsidering? That maybe two boys were too much trouble after all?

The questions I couldn't ask hung between us like the summer heat, thick
and suffocating.

The Quiet Drive

The drive away from Boys Town was subdued. Even the radio seemed muted,
its songs blending with the endless cornfields outside our windows. In
the back seat, Dave's hand found mine - a simple gesture that carried
everything we couldn't say aloud.

We were different boys from different places, but we were real brothers
now. Whatever Boys Town represented, whatever fears it had stirred up,
we belonged to each other and to this family traveling west together.

Our westward journey ended in Denver. Dad, too tired to continue and
unwilling to let Mom drive, declared Los Angeles a destination for
another time.

That night in the motel, Dave's steady breathing next to me felt
different somehow. The statue boys' faces kept appearing in my mind -
one carrying the other, the weight shared between them.

I thought about Mom's struggles to parent two such different boys, about
the way Dave and I had each found our own ways to earn love and
approval. I thought about Dad's bowling alley and the spaces where he
went to be himself, away from Mom's expectations and our needs.

But mostly I thought about Dave's hand in mine during that quiet drive,
and how being brothers meant something deeper than either of us fully
understood yet.

Dave and I were learning that families are complicated, that love comes
in different forms, and that sometimes the people who care about you
most are also the ones who struggle most to know what to do with you.

But we were learning it together, and that made all the difference.

Finding My Way

Back home from our truncated trip, something had shifted inside me. The
group home visit, the Boys Town statue, the weight of being the
"difficult" one - it all pressed down like a stone in my chest. I went
straight to my room, then slipped out the back door to the park. The
familiar sounds of kids playing, the creak of swings, the thud of
basketballs - it all felt safer than the quiet tension inside our house.

I hung from the jungle gym, stretching my body, breathing deeply to calm
myself.

Then I got on the swings. I used to be afraid of swinging high, afraid
that I would fall off. But not today. Today, I wanted to go higher than
ever. As I kicked my feet out and back, I felt the old painted wooden
seat creak against the metal hooks that attached it to the chains. The
wood would not crack. The chains would not break. I would not fall. Not
today. Not ever.

I didn't know it yet, but Walter's invitation to U of D High would
become my escape route - not just from Mom's expectations, but from the
version of myself that everyone at home thought they knew.
