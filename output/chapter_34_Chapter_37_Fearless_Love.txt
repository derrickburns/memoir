Chapter 34: Fearless Love
The kitchen in our Queens Airbnb was small—barely big enough for two people to pass without bumping elbows. But that morning, Jamil commanded it like he was back in that Italian cooking class ten years ago, when a local grandmother had taught our family to make fresh pasta from scratch.
He moved with the same focused intensity now, every gesture deliberate. The way he chose each avocado, pressing gently to test its ripeness. How he diced shallots with precise, even cuts, the knife work rhythmic and sure. The careful attention he paid to the heat under his pan, adjusting the flame with the confidence of someone who understood that cooking was an act of devotion.
This was Jamil's love language—and he was fluent.
The scent of caramelizing shallots filled the small space as he folded them into scrambled eggs that he'd been whisking to perfect peaks. French toast soaked in vanilla-scented custard waited its turn on the griddle. Fresh fruit arranged in careful patterns. Coffee brewing strong and dark.
"Everybody sit," he called, his voice carrying the authority of a chef who'd just orchestrated something beautiful. "It's ready."
We gathered around the small table—me, Gina, Maya, Jamil—four adults crowded into a space meant for a quick breakfast, but somehow it felt exactly right. The morning light streamed through windows overlooking Queens rooftops, and the aroma of Jamil's feast made the cramped space feel like the most important place in the world.
We were here in New York City to celebrate cousin Jasmine Gregory's solo exhibition, "Who Wants to Die for Glamour" at the Museum of Modern Art PS1. Despite having a full time job, separated by three time zones from the east coast relatives, and nine from Jasmine, Maya had crafted a multi-day itinerary for family to gather. She'd taken it upon herself to organize this reunion and to pay homage to Jasmine, now a major artist in Geneva, Switzerland. I never understood artists. How do they make a living? Somehow Jasmine had figured it out!
The day before, at the exhibition, I had walked with pride. My niece, though not my blood, had put herself via her art on full display. What courage that took! I studied the paintings. One featured a boy piloting a boat as his father hovered over him, guiding him to accept his place among the owners of the finest things and his inheritance of membership in the top caste. I chuckled. The meaning was so clear to me. I asked other family members how they interpreted the pieces. Most were silent, summarizing the art eventually as "abstract."
"Artists see things differently than us," one offered.
Perhaps, but we are the audience, and I felt this one deeply.
I approached Jasmine and suggested my interpretation.
"Exactly," she said, in a way that suggested that the interpretation should be obvious!
Maya was glowing. At thirty-four, having orchestrated this family gathering around Jasmine's triumph, she had that particular happiness that comes from being exactly where you want to be, with exactly the people you want to be with.
"Oh, Dad," she said, cutting into Jamil's French toast, "I meant to tell you earlier. Remember that article I sent you? The one co-authored by your birth father?"
I nodded, fork paused halfway to my mouth. The 1962 research paper on communicator credibility—dry academic work that I'd filed away without much thought.
"Well, I reached out to the other author. Elliot Aronson. He's ninety-two now, lives in Santa Cruz." She said it casually, like she was mentioning the weather.
The fork completed its journey to my mouth, but I barely tasted Jamil's perfect creation. "You... reached out to him?"
"Through his website. I found out we have a connection—his great-nephew Brendan was in my business school class." Maya's voice carried that same fearless confidence I'd watched her display her entire life. The same tone she'd used at eight years old when she announced she was going to dive off the ten-meter platform, despite never having done anything higher than the three-meter board.
"He wrote back," she continued, pulling out her phone. "Want to hear what he said?"
Before I could answer, she was reading:
"'Dear Maya, Wow! How exciting. I was very fond of Burton, a smart, courageous young man. We worked together in 1960-61 when I was a new assistant professor at Harvard. Your grandfather was taking my class on social influence, and our publication marked my first collaboration with an undergraduate...'"
Maya's voice faded into background as the words settled into me. Smart, courageous young man. Burton—the abstract figure I'd carried as a question mark my entire life—suddenly had dimension. Had presence.
"'He was one of the few black students at Harvard at that time,'" Maya continued reading, "'even conducting a study on prejudice. Burton had approached me to collaborate, and together they ran an experiment... His resilience, using Jackie Robinson as a model, left a lasting impression...'"
The kitchen went quiet except for the gentle sizzle still coming from Jamil's pan. I could feel my family's eyes on me, but I was somewhere else entirely. Seeing Burton as a young man not much older than Maya was now, walking across Harvard Yard in 1960, carrying himself with the kind of courage that left impressions on professors decades later.
"This brings tears to my eyes," I heard myself say, my voice thick. "Burton was such a bright light, full of passion for learning and life. I was the same at that age, yearning to contribute to humanity. I feel a deep sadness that he felt he had to extinguish that light."
The tears came then, not the controlled kind I'd learned to manage, but the real ones that surprise you with their intensity. Jamil reached across the table, his hand finding my shoulder. Gina's fingers intertwined with mine.
But it was Maya I couldn't stop looking at. Maya, who had fearlessly reached across sixty years to connect me with something I didn't even know I needed. Just like she'd fearlessly launched herself off that diving platform, trusting that the water would catch her. Just like she'd fearlessly charged toward fly balls in right field, diving at full speed without hesitation, or thrown out runners from her knees with perfect accuracy and total confidence.
While I had spent decades learning to drop my performance and connect authentically, Maya had been living that way all along. And now she was using that fearless love to heal parts of me I hadn't even known were broken.
I looked around that cramped Queens kitchen—at Jamil, who had poured his soul into feeding us; at Maya, who had poured her courage into connecting me with my history; at Gina, who had poured three decades into helping me become someone worthy of this moment.
For the first time, I truly understood what it meant to be surrounded by fearless love. And I realized that my children hadn't learned authenticity despite my years of performance—they had learned it from watching me finally become myself.
The tears kept coming, but they felt like gratitude now. Gratitude for a daughter brave enough to dive deep, and a son who knew that love tastes like perfectly caramelized shallots and vanilla-scented French toast, served with absolute devotion on a Sunday morning in Queens.

What does it mean to build a life from the spaces between worlds?
Born to a Jewish mother and Black father in 1964 Detroit, adopted into a loving Black family, Derrick R. Burns discovered that the answer lay not in choosing sides, but in building bridges.
From the basement sign that asked "Are you grateful for such wonderful, loving parents?" to a cancer diagnosis that stripped away all pretense, this memoir traces a sixty-year journey from survival through performance to authentic presence. Through Princeton's halls, Silicon Valley's innovation labs, family loss, and life-threatening illness, Derrick learns that our deepest wounds can become our greatest sources of strength.
More than an adoption story, From Walls to Bridges is a masterwork of contemporary memoir—a sophisticated three-act journey that transforms individual struggle into universal wisdom about identity, belonging, and the radical power of chosen family. It demonstrates how the spaces "between worlds" that initially isolate us can become the foundation for healing divisions across all manner of differences.
This is the story of how walls built for protection become bridges toward connection—and how the greatest achievements emerge not through performance, but through fearless love.

Derrick R. Burns is a Princeton graduate and Silicon Valley veteran whose memoir represents a sophisticated achievement in contemporary life writing. He lives in San Mateo with his wife Gina.
