Chapter 30: A Problem to Overcome
The Drive Home
I drove home in a daze. The Tesla's navigation system guided me—"In 500 feet, turn left"—but I existed in a tunnel between my steering wheel and the car ahead of me. Buildings, sidewalks, people dissolved into peripheral static. When I found myself in our driveway, I couldn't remember a single turn.
Inside, I called Steve Van. Beyond his diabetes, Steve has wrestled with health crises for decades. If anyone could guide me through this territory, it was him.
"I'm scared," I admitted, the words feeling foreign in my mouth.
"D, you need to treat this like a problem to overcome," he said, his voice steady with hard-won wisdom.
A problem to overcome.
The CT Scan and Biopsy
The same day, the CT scan came first, delivering its clinical verdict: "Enhancing soft tissue mass at the left base of tongue measuring approximately 3.6 x 2.4 cm x 3.6 cm, suspicious for neoplasm, likely squamous cell carcinoma. Multiple bilateral nonspecific small nonpathologically enlarged lymph nodes. However, one 9 mm left cervical lymph node is necrotic suggesting a site of nodal metastatic disease."
Numbers. Clinical measurements of something growing inside me that I couldn't feel or see, like discovering a stranger had been living in my house all along.
That afternoon, Gina drove us to the main hospital for the biopsy. The fog had lifted, but everything felt wrapped in gauze—too bright, too sharp, too real.
In the surgical prep area, a nurse with gentle hands started my IV. "This is Gabapentin," she explained. "It'll help you relax."
The medication hit my system like a warm wave, and suddenly I was talking too much, cracking jokes that probably weren't funny. Anything to fill the silence that kept trying to swallow us.
An hour later, I was rolled into the operating room.
"Count backward from ten," she said, adjusting my oxygen mask.
"Ten, nine, eight..."
No.
"Dreamland."
Later, Gina told me the surgeon had explained everything right after the procedure. But those moments disappeared into the fog of anesthesia. That's why I needed Gina there—not just as my wife of thirty-four years, but as the person who could hold onto the pieces of me I was losing track of.
The first biopsy came back the next day.
Inconclusive.
Doctor Tang remained unwavering in his diagnosis.
"Mr. Burns, I am convinced you have squamous cell cancer, but we need a positive pathology report before I can present your case to the tumor board and start your treatment."
Tumor board. Is this the medical panel that denies medical care that Republicans talked about when trying to block Obamacare?
"Are you available Friday, November 10?"
"Yes" I said immediately. What could be more important on my calendar?
"Ok, good. I'll cut until we have proof," Doctor Tang announced.
How do I respond to that? "Great, doc, cut all you need!"
Telling the Children
That evening, still drowsy from the biopsy drugs, Gina and I had agreed to tell the kids. We called a family meeting for 8 PM—not unusual in our house, but we'd never gathered to discuss a parent's mortality.
I walked around the neighborhood first, barely able to put one foot in front of the other as the anesthesia wore off. When I returned, I sat in the living room staring at my iPhone calendar. Christmas plans suddenly felt like wishes written in disappearing ink.
Jamil and Alexa came into the living room. Maya and Harold joined us on Zoom from Los Angeles, their faces compressed into pixels on our laptop screen, trying to bridge three hundred miles of worry.
"I have squamous cell carcinoma at the base of my tongue," I began. The medical words were familiar after thirty-three years of marriage to an internist, but using "I" in front of them felt like speaking a foreign language. "I'll have radiation and chemotherapy. Steve told me to treat this like a problem to overcome, and that's what I'm going to do."
The questions came rapid-fire. Maya: "How long have you had it?" Jamil: "How big is the tumor?" Both: "What's the prognosis? When do you start treatment?"
I answered what I could, but mostly I wanted to own this moment. To establish early that this was my battle to fight.
Maya made her decision immediately. "We're coming up. Harold can work remotely, and I can take time off."
"You don't need to—" I started.
"Yes, we do," she said with that familiar Burns family determination that both infuriated and comforted me.
"How are you doing?" Gina asked, her physician's voice mixing with her wife's worry.
I wanted to say I was fine, that I'd handle it like every other challenge. Instead, I heard myself saying, "I'm scared."
"Of dying?"
"Of not being able to speak. Of not being able to eat with you. Of becoming someone you have to take care of instead of someone you choose to be with."
We sat in the blinking light, holding hands like teenagers, neither of us having answers but both of us finally naming what felt true.
Happy Birthday
Two days later, November 4th, we celebrated Jamil's birthday at home. Gina cooked a wonderful meal. Jamil donned our traditional family velvet birthday hat from a long-ago trip to Disneyland, a silly striped thing we'd been using for birthdays for years. He sat at our kitchen table, leaning forward to blow out the colorful "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" candles on the chocolate cake that she made. Gina sat across from him in her coral sweatshirt, her hand near her face, fighting back emotions—the bittersweetness of trying to maintain birthday joy while processing my diagnosis just forty-eight hours old.
Without telling anyone, Jamil and I had some recreational drugs. He played some Cumbia music. No, he played one song, Como Te Voy A Olvidar by the Los Angeles Azules,
over and over. The heavy brass section drilled into my psyche, straight to my emotional core. Jamil went upstairs, music blaring on all the Sonos speakers in our house. I danced around the oval dining room table, spinning in circles like the earth around the sun, leaning off center. Jamil came back downstairs thirty minutes later, sobbing uncontrollably. I hugged him. "What happened?" I asked.
"I want Mom," he said, like a five-year-old boy reeling in pain after having broken his favorite toy. And the three of us embraced, Jamil hunched over grabbing Gina's waist. And then I realized, what happened is... cancer.
The Cuts
"Hello Derrick. Hello Gina," Doctor Tang greeted me as I lay in bed with an IV in the preoperative holding area.
During the second procedure, the pathologist was present in the lab next to the surgical suite, examining samples under the microscope as Doctor Tang cut. The first four samples came back benign—A, B, C, D. All superficial. All normal squamous tissue. No dysplasia seen.
Then came the deeper cuts. E, F, G, H, I. Each one positive for P16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. The deeper Doctor Tang went, the more cancer he found.
"Mr. Burns, I had to cut deep to get to the cancer. There was a great deal of inflammation and necrotic tissue."
Necrotic. Dead. No, don't think about "dead."
The pathology report would later spell it out in clinical language: "Strong p16 positivity is a reliable surrogate for high risk HPV." My ghost from college, buried forty years deep, had been quietly building this tumor at the base of my tongue.
HPV is nearly universal, with tens of millions of men infected, but fewer than 1%—about 1 in 3,000 per year—will ever develop oropharyngeal cancer from it. In my case, the virus was latent for years—dormant and not contagious—before reactivating and leading to cancer, an uncommon outcome of a common infection. Yeah, lucky me.
The Wait
Five days to go before the PET scan felt like an eternity. Each morning, consciousness arrived with the same brutal reminder. I have cancer, and it could kill me soon.
I went through the motions—meetings, phone calls, emails—but everything felt provisional, written in pencil. I caught myself ending sentences with "if" and "maybe." Even my calendar seemed to mock me, its dates stretching beyond what might be possible.
On November 15, 2023, the PET scan results brought our first real breath: "No suspicious right neck nodes. No findings to suggest distant metastatic disease." Clear. No metastasis to my brain or liver—the death sentence scenarios Doctor Tang had warned about. The cancer was contained to my throat and one lymph node.
The tumor board confirmed the recommendation: synchronized chemotherapy and radiation.
"I plan to go away for Thanksgiving."
But how would I be around my daughter's in-laws? They are so loving, so joyful. Would I be able to engage, to be present, to show them the love that they had shown us?
"Mr. Burns, I recommend you start as soon as possible."
"How about the week after Thanksgiving?"
"December second."
Meeting Doctor Katzel
Pathology confirmed the diagnosis—squamous cell cancer—and I was assigned to Doctor Jed Katzel, head of head and neck cancer treatment across Kaiser nationwide.
"Hi Mr. Burns, Jed Katzel," he said, extending a firm handshake.
"Hello Doctor Katzel. You know my wife Gina."
"Yes, hello Gina." His smile reached his eyes. "I've reviewed your case. You have P-16 positive squamous cell cancer—HPV-related, which means a better prognosis than tobacco-related cancers. It's highly treatable and often curable with radiation and chemotherapy. But I need to be honest—the treatment is among the most difficult in oncology."
A small blessing wrapped in a terrible diagnosis.
The clinical language couldn't mask what we both understood—this was a battle I could win, but the war would exact its price.
For the first time since meeting Doctor Tang, I broke down.
"Doctor Katzel," I said, my voice cracking, "my mother couldn't handle the chemotherapy. The mouth sores were unbearable. And my father, after his stroke, could barely speak. This sounds like both of their worst symptoms combined."
Tears streamed down my eyes, clouding my vision as I looked Doctor Katzel in the face. I had spent my childhood learning to suppress tears, summoning anger or even dissociating. This time, there was no running away, nothing to vent anger at. God? Even if I professed a belief in God, every God I had studied was merciful.
He set down his pen and met my gaze directly. "It will be difficult," he said, his tone gentle but firm. "But I don't think you'll suffer like your parents did. We have better supportive care now. And I promise you this—we will get you through this."
I looked at him, really looked at him, and saw something I desperately needed: certainty. Not about the outcome, but about the fight. The tears stopped, not because I forced them away, but because I recognized the promise in his words. This time, I wouldn't face it alone.
The Consent Form
Doctor Katzel pulled out the consent form—several pages thick. His pen hovered over each item as he read aloud, his voice steady and clinical. With each new side effect, my stomach knotted tighter.
"The radiation will likely cause burns, similar to a severe sunburn, both inside and outside your throat."
No.
I was not afraid now. I listened, but I believed. Doctor Katzel is the national leader. Gina believes in him, and she and Kaiser have never steered me wrong.
"The common effects you can expect: dry mouth, loss of taste, swallowing difficulties, radiation burns on your neck, crushing fatigue. From the chemotherapy—nausea, hearing changes like tinnitus, low white blood cells."
He continued methodically. "Less common but possible: severe mouth and throat ulcers called mucositis, neck muscle tightening, long-term swallowing problems, dental decay requiring extractions, voice changes, peripheral neuropathy in your hands and feet, moderate hearing loss, kidney strain that we'll monitor closely."
Each possibility echoed with memories of my parents' suffering. Mom, unable to eat, her mouth too raw from chemotherapy. Dad, struggling to form words after his stroke, frustration clouding his eyes.
"The rare but serious effects: permanent feeding tube dependence, jawbone damage, severe hearing loss, chronic pain, even secondary cancers decades later..."
The words hung between us like a sword.
I decided then to expect the common side effects and to assume the best. I could do this. I can do hard things.
I took the release form. Hadn't I already agreed to the treatment? Oh, right. Liability. I need to sign.
December 2nd - First Treatment
The morning of my first treatment, I woke at 5:30 without an alarm. Gina was already awake beside me, staring at the ceiling.
"Can't sleep either?" I asked.
"I was thinking about breakfast. What sounds good?"
Such a normal question. Such a married-couple-of-thirty-years question.
Gina had planned to retire early next year, after finding a suitable doctor for each of her 1,000 patients. But with my diagnosis, she moved her date sooner.
"Kaiser will assign them someone," she said, trying to sound matter-of-fact, when in reality she felt like she was letting them down. After over 30 years with some of the patients, she would very likely never see them again.
Her sacrifice humbled me. While I focused on my own fears, she was quietly dismantling the career she'd built patient by patient, relationship by relationship.
"Oatmeal with bananas," I said, though I usually grabbed a croissant and coffee at my local shop. This morning, I wanted to be home. I wanted Gina to take care of me.
While she showered, I walked through our house, really seeing it. The vinyl flooring we'd replaced in the master bathroom, cutting and shaving each square to fit perfectly around the door jamb. The carpet we'd changed throughout the upstairs. The kids' bedrooms we'd gutted together. I had rewired the lights and outlets personally, painted every wall and ceiling.
Had I caused this? All those years of sugar addiction—that time I'd consumed an entire sixteen ounce bag of chocolate peanut butter cups and ended up with a kidney stone. Did the cancer feed off the excess sugar in my bloodstream? On my tongue itself?
This time, I put my bowl and spoon directly in the dishwasher instead of leaving them in the sink—a habit that had always annoyed Gina, a relic from my childhood when Mom didn't own a dishwasher. Small gestures suddenly felt enormous.
As we drove north on Highway 101, I thought about my mother's experience. Would I end up in a hospital bed, helpless and diminished? No. Doctor Katzel had been clear—this was outpatient treatment. I would sit in a chair for six hours with an IV. The radiation would be even quicker but more frequent: five days a week for seven weeks instead of once every three weeks.
The revelation felt almost as significant as the diagnosis itself: I could fight this from home.
Despite having "good veins," it took the nurse three attempts to place the IV in my hand.
"The hand is better," she explained. "It gives you more freedom to move."
"We'll start with basic fluids. When you need the bathroom, just disconnect the power from the wall socket. The drip continues on battery. Bathrooms are down the hall."
As the first treatment began, I felt something unexpected: not fear, but a strange kind of relief. The waiting was over. The fight had begun.
After three visits, I became a pro, dragging my IV pole like a reluctant dance partner to the nearby bathroom.
And I was still myself—scared, determined, and ready to treat this like a problem to overcome.
