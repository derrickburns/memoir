Chapter 25: Final Gestures

The Call

Three years had passed since Marcia and I had parted ways, our
estrangement still an open wound. It was early morning when the phone
rang, and my Uncle David's somber voice pierced the silence. Marcia had
suffered a catastrophic brain aneurysm. Though she was stable, she lay
in a coma.

I was numb. I always thought that we would have time to reconcile. I was
so accustomed to Marcia coming into and out of my life. But there would
be no reconciliation this time. That opportunity had passed, and I would
have to live with that.

The news hit me in waves, first shock, then a peculiar emptiness,
followed by regret. Not regret for things done, but for things left
undone, words left unsaid. Though our relationship had been fraught with
complications, Marcia was still the woman who had given me life. My
existence began with her. And now, suddenly, unexpectedly, that
connection was about to be severed permanently.

David extended an invitation for me to join him and Cara in Florida,
where Marcia was hospitalized, to say our final goodbyes.

The Last Goodbye

I traveled to Florida and joined the somber gathering at the hospital:
Cara, her partner Dave, Uncle David, and his wife Debbie. Entering the
room, my breath caught in my throat. Marcia lay motionless in the
hospital bed, a breathing tube down her throat and another tube draining
blood from her skull. A patch of her beautiful hair had been shaved, an
indignity that my vain Marcia would have loathed. Yet there she was,
seemingly at peace, moving only with the mechanical rhythm of the
breathing machine.

Time seemed to slow as we absorbed the gravity of the situation.
Eventually, Marcia's doctor entered the room. His words were gentle but
firm: though her condition was stable, she was almost certainly brain
dead, her brain irreparably damaged by the swelling. After he left, we
convened as a family to make an agonizing decision.

When the doctor returned, we conveyed our choice to withdraw life
support. He nodded understandingly and asked us to step out while the
nurses removed the tubes from her body.

Returning to the room, I saw Marcia lying there, appearing more at rest
than before. I took my place at her right side, Cara at her left. I
reached out, holding her hand as it lay still.

Then, unexpectedly, Marcia's hand moved, pulling mine to her heart. The
motion, whether voluntary or not, was unmistakable. A surge of emotion
coursed through me. Was this a final, silent message?

Within half an hour, Marcia's breathing ceased. The declaration of her
death echoed through the room, final and irreversible. We lingered
beside her lifeless body, grappling with the swift reality of her
passing. There were no regrets, only a profound need to process the
rapid sequence of events.

A Question of Love

A couple of hours later, we gathered at a local restaurant for brunch.
We took our seats at the table, the elder men at each end, Cara to my
right, David opposite me. The waitress introduced herself and
distributed menus, the kind you might find at a Denny’s, hard, plastic,
and somewhat greasy.
“Can I get anyone coffee or juice?”
“Yes, I will have coffee.”
“Me too.”
Just another day, right?

We selected our meals, and as we waited for the waitress to return, I
broke the silence. "Was Marcia's pulling her hand up a final signal of
her rejection of me?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

Cara shook her head strongly.

"No," she said softly, "she was pulling your hand to her heart to tell
you she loves you." Debbie quickly voiced her agreement with Cara. I
looked up at David, wondering if he shared my dark sense of humor or
Debbie’s sensitivity.
“Well, …” his voice trailed off.

The little boy in me clung to Cara's comforting words, yet the rational
engineer within knew that neither interpretation could be true if she
was indeed brain dead. The truth remained elusive, but in that moment, I
chose to believe in love.

That choice wasn't just about Marcia, it was about me. About deciding
what story I would carry forward. The facts were unclear, ambiguous,
like so much of my relationship with Marcia had been. But in this final
chapter, I had the power to choose the meaning I would assign to her
last gesture. And I chose love, not because it was certain, but because
it was healing.

The Broken Bond

Marcia and I both wanted very desperately to belong. As hard as we both
tried, we could not give that to each other. Our bond had been
irrevocably broken and replaced with the adoption myth, a story that we
both know glossed over a pain so deep that it could never be spoken. The
drunk stork did deliver the baby to wonderful loving parents, but she
took the baby from an emotionally devastated mother.

As I flew home from Florida, I reflected on the strange symmetry of my
life, how I had now been present for the deaths of both my mothers, the
one who gave me life and the one who raised me. Each had given me
something essential, something irreplaceable. Each had shaped me in ways
both visible and invisible.

With Marcia's passing, a chapter of my life closed definitively. There
would be no more cycles of tentative connection and painful withdrawal,
no more attempts to forge a relationship that could never quite bridge
the fundamental rupture at its core. That particular pain was over.

What remained was the task of integration, of finding a way to hold
these complex, sometimes contradictory pieces of my history in a
coherent whole, of acknowledging both the losses and the gifts that came
from being a child of two mothers, of multiple worlds.

The plane climbed through clouds toward California, carrying me back to
the family I had created, the life I had built. Below me, Florida
receded, taking with it the woman who had first carried me beneath her
heart. I closed my eyes, feeling the gentle pressure of Marcia's final
gesture, real or imagined, pulling my hand toward her heart. Whatever it
meant, I would carry it with me, one last connection to bridge the
divide that had defined us both.

With Marcia's death, a complicated chapter finally closed, bringing
strange peace rather than fresh anguish. But losing Jala would be
different—not the complex grief of difficult relationships, but the pure
devastation of losing someone whose love had been uncomplicated and
true.
