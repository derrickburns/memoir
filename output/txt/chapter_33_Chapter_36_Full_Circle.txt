Chapter 33: Full Circle

The Zoom meeting window reflected back a version of myself I barely
recognized - thinner, grayer, but somehow more present. My heart raced
as I waited for my new boss’s boss to join, not from the cancer
treatments this time, but from a different kind of survival instinct.
After decades in Silicon Valley, I knew what reorganizations meant. The
familiar signs were all there: my boss's boss departing, a new
aggressive leader taking charge, an increase in tension and anxiety.

"Why haven't you solved the problems?" The words cut through the digital
space, carrying the sharp edge of Silicon Valley's relentless drive.

I felt the familiar tightness in my chest, but this time it sparked
something new - clarity rather than anxiety. After facing mortality,
corporate politics felt surprisingly small. The collaborative,
respectful environment I'd helped build was already shifting, and I
recognized the aggressive style I'd encountered years ago at Google. The
water wasn't just rising; it was changing temperature.

My oncologist's words echoed:

"Most people take six months off after a diagnosis like yours."

But I had pushed to return sooner, still caught in the old patterns of
proving myself. Thirty minutes into that first meeting left me exhausted
in a way no amount of corporate determination could overcome.

"Doc, I'm not ready," I admitted during my next checkup.

"I have no stamina."

He nodded, unsurprised.

"Aim for May 2nd. Give your body time to heal completely."

Over lunch with Willie Hooks, my longtime mentor, I found myself
questioning everything I thought I knew about success. Willie had walked
this path before me, stepping away from the corporate ladder in his
fifties to pursue a different kind of impact.

"What do you really want now?" Willie asked, his question cutting
through my rehearsed answers about career advancement.

"Quality of life," I answered, surprising myself with the immediacy of
the response.

"Flexibility. Trust. The chance to mentor others. Time to travel. Space
to keep learning."

The promotion to chief architect that once seemed so natural, now felt
like a relic from another life. Under the previous SVP, someone I'd
built trust with, it might have made sense. But now? The respect of my
immediate colleagues, the daily joy of solving problems, the freedom to
learn and grow - these were the real measures of success.

I decided to stay a bit longer, knowing it was temporary. My
relationships with my boss, peers, and team remained strong and
fulfilling. But the writing was on the wall with the new leadership. I
still struggled with accepting the ending: being sent out to pasture
without so much as a simple “thank you”. However, I felt no panic about
the future. Cancer had taught me something about time - it couldn't be
saved or stored, only spent. The question was no longer about survival,
but about choice.

Looking at my reflection in the Zoom window, I saw someone who had
finally learned to read not just the water level, but the currents
beneath. The corporate world hadn't changed - I had. The masks I'd worn
for decades, the performances I'd perfected, the constant adaptation to
others' expectations - all of it felt heavier now, less necessary. I had
faced death and emerged with a different understanding of what it meant
to live.

My calendar still filled with meetings, my Slack channels still beckoned
with new unread messages, but I approached it all with a new
perspective. Each day was a choice now - to stay or go, to engage or
step back, to perform or simply be. The tick-tock of corporate time no
longer drove my decisions. I had found a different rhythm, one that
matched the beating of my healing heart.
