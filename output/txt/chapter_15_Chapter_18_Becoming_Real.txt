Chapter 15: Becoming Real

Opening Scene (1995)

The digital clock on the nightstand glowed 6:17 AM when I first heard
Maya's excited whisper to Jamil in the hallway. Their footsteps padded
past our bedroom door, hushed but vibrating with barely contained
energy.

"Mama, is Santa here?" Maya's stage whisper carried through the door.

"Shh, let's wait for Dad," Gina murmured back.

I pulled the comforter over my head, creating a cave of darkness. The
weight pressed against my chest, not just fabric, but the accumulation
of a thousand small failures. What terrified me most wasn't failing at
the performance, but the possibility that there was nothing authentic
beneath it.

Gina's side of the bed dipped as she sat beside me. "Derrick, it's
almost seven. The kids have been up since six."

Her voice was carefully neutral, devoid of the frustration I knew she
must feel. I grunted in response, still hidden.

"They're waiting," she added softly.

When Maya's voice finally called from downstairs, "Daddddd?! Santa
came!", the plaintive note pierced through my fog. I pictured them
cross-legged by the tree we'd decorated together, their eyes scanning
the presents. They weren't waiting for Santa. They were waiting, for me.

With mechanical movements, I swung my legs over the side of the bed.

The Professional Self (1988-1990)

At SGI, I'd found a professional identity that clicked into place
naturally. I was valued for my mind, my problem-solving abilities, and
my collaborative spirit. I belonged without explanation.

The elevator doors opened at building 6, and I stepped into a scene that
still felt surreal. Engineers in t-shirts and shorts sprawled across
bean bag chairs, arguing passionately about RISC vs CISC architecture. A
unicycle leaned against a whiteboard covered in equations.

"Burns!" Rick called from across the lobby.

"We need you for the football team. Defensive line."

Later that day, hunched over a keyboard with Vince, we attacked a memory
allocation bug. My fingers flew across the keys, finding that sweet spot
where mathematics met real-world problems. Unlike my struggles with
theoretical CS courses, this felt natural.

"Got it," I announced as the code finally ran clean.

Walking back to my desk, I passed offices with revolutionary graphics
machines. Each one held Marc's innovation inside. A smile formed on my
face. The emerging 3D graphics powerhouse was founded by a Black man
from the midwest! Someone had already been here, had already excelled.

That Friday, during our pickup basketball game, I blocked Kirk's shot
with more force than necessary, sending the ball sailing into the
bleachers.

"Damn, Derrick!" Kirk laughed, jogging after the ball.

"Save some for the other team." James tossed me the ball.

"Pick and roll."

For once, I didn't need to borrow moves or channel someone else's
confidence. I just played, fully, authentically me.

Unexpected Fatherhood (1990)

Sunday morning sunlight filtered through our kitchen blinds. Gina pushed
her untouched toast away and sipped water instead of coffee.

"You okay?" I asked, glancing up from the newspaper.

"Not really."

When she emerged, her face was pale, holding a white plastic stick with
a small window in its center.

"I'm pregnant."

The kitchen clock ticked. Five, six, seven seconds of silence.

"Say something," she whispered.

My mouth went dry.

"You're sure?"

Inside, I screamed: "A baby! I am a grad student. I am not ready!"

"That's wonderful," I exclaimed!

My hand reached for hers, squeezing with an actor's precision.

Learning to Be Real (1990-1992)

When they placed Maya in my arms, time suspended. A full head of hair
crowned her tiny face, eyes finding mine with an intensity that felt
like recognition. Her tiny fingers wrapped around my index finger with
the gravity of a question I wasn't yet ready to answer.

For the first time, I saw a face like mine. As an adopted child with no
biological mirrors in my family, this connection hit me with unexpected
force. Growing up as a "mixed" child had been like being an
extraterrestrial visitor, dropped into humanity without a clear lineage.
Questions of "What are you?" had always haunted me, not from a place of
racial identity, but from a deeper alienation of seeming to lack visible
roots.

Now, looking at Maya, I finally had an answer to the lifelong question
"What are you?", I am her father. Her features echoed mine, a biological
connection that anchored me to Earth in a way I'd never before
experienced.

But parenthood offered no clear parameters like my work at SGI. Maya's
demands interrupted the mental focus that made me successful
professionally. While debugging code required uninterrupted thought,
parenting demanded constant context-switching and emotional presence I
hadn't yet learned to provide.

At nine months, Maya was walking. Jamil arrived in 1992, earning his
nickname "Mr. Smiley" with an infectious laugh that could transform my
darkest moods. Where Maya demanded attention, Jamil absorbed the world
around him, simultaneously curious and cautious.

Gina's challenges became clearer to me. One evening, after a
particularly grueling shift, she dropped her hospital bag and leaned
against the kitchen counter. "Doctor Coleman asked if I was 'planning to
stay committed' after having the kids," she said, her voice flat. "As if
motherhood was some kind of professional weakness."

She was juggling a demanding medical career while raising our kids,
navigating a world where someone like her, Black, female, working
mother, wasn't who her colleagues pictured when they thought "doctor."

I saw her exhaustion, her quiet defiance. I admired her strength but
didn't know how to truly support her.

Moments of Truth

That June 1995 evening, I knelt on the floor reassembling the kids' bunk
bed. Maya watched critically.

"Dad, you are doing it wrong," she said matter-of-factly.

For a moment, I felt that familiar defensiveness rise. But something in
her expectant face stopped me.

"You know what? You're right," I admitted. "Let's fix it together."

Her smile contained no judgment, only delight at collaboration. We spent
the next hour rebuilding, Maya handing me exactly the right screws
without being asked. When we finished, the bed stood perfectly.

"We did good, Dad," she declared, patting my hand.

In that moment, we weren't performing roles, but simply working
together, seeing and responding to each other's needs without pretense.
The relief of that authentic connection felt like coming up for air
after swimming underwater too long.

Looking Forward

Sitting there on Christmas morning, I felt like I was watching someone
else's life through glass. I had everything I was supposed to want, yet
something was missing.

Maya's handprint, painted in SGI's blue and green, hung on the wall, a
"World's Best Dad" plaque that felt more like a challenge than a
celebration. At work, I wrote clean code that made machines sing; at
home, I struggled to decode my own children's needs.

My search for identity, as an adopted son, as a father, was really one
journey. Who am I beneath the performances and expectations? Perhaps in
seeking answers, I might finally learn to be present, to be real.

The man who hid under the covers that morning was still learning how to
emerge. The hardest role I'd ever have to play, I was beginning to
understand, wasn't a role at all, it was simply being myself.
