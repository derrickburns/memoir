Chapter 22: A Father's Love

"Your serve, Dad."

And in an instant, Dad flicked his left hand to send the ping pong ball
screaming across the net, slight smirk on his face. I lunged for it,
barely returning the shot, only for him to place the ball perfectly in
the corner beyond my reach. That left hand of his, quick, precise,
deadly on the ping pong table. He never showed mercy in our games,
believing that earning victory was the only way to truly appreciate it.
Years later, I would understand the gift in this approach, but then, I
just wanted to finally beat him, to see pride replace that smirk. That
competitive fire, that insistence on earning everything, it defined how
Dad approached not just games, but life itself.

Their Rhythm

As I settled into my life in California, my parents found a new rhythm
together on Shields Street in Detroit. I like to think that I called
frequently, checking in on their health and happiness, but I had no
regular pattern.

During the winters, they visited Uncle Bubba and Aunt Mildred in
Florida, like many Michigan snowbirds seeking refuge from the cold.

Mom poured her heart into the Stork's Nest project, a noble cause
spearheaded by Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. and the March of Dimes
Foundation. Her dedication aimed to ensure that more women received
essential prenatal care, striving to prevent the heartbreak of low
birthweight, premature births, and infant deaths.

Even long after I left for college, Dad maintained his unwavering
routine. Every weekday at 7 AM, he made the familiar 5.6-mile drive down
Mound Road to the military base in Warren, where his job at TACOM
involved managing payroll for both military personnel and civilian
employees. The work demanded meticulous attention to detail and a strong
grasp of financial systems, qualities Dad possessed in abundance.

He remained dedicated to this role until his retirement in 1986,
completing 35 years of federal service. But Dad's timing wasn't
coincidental, he deliberately waited until I graduated from college
before retiring, ensuring I had the resources I needed to finish my
education.

Dad came alive at the bowling alley. The strikes and spares mattered,
but what truly drew him in was the brotherhood, a place where he
belonged completely. He threw himself into leadership roles with The
National Bowling Association, an organization founded in 1939 Detroit as
black bowlers sought to build their own community around the sport they
loved.

Bowling was beautifully democratic, inexpensive enough that class
barriers fell away on the lanes. By 1944, when the group became the
National Bowling Association, Inc., Dad was part of something powerful.
These men and women were creating their own space, their own traditions,
launching the "Equality in Bowling" campaign that opened doors across
the sport in 1950.

For Dad, those long evenings at the lanes meant finding his tribe, men
who understood both the weight of responsibility and the sweet
satisfaction of knocking down pins that had no choice but to fall.

During tax season, Dad's love of numbers became an act of service. He
prepared tax returns for friends and neighbors, charging exactly $2, not
because the work wasn't worth more, but because that small fee
transformed help into a transaction, preserving everyone's dignity.
Numbers were Dad's language of care.

To prepare, he brought home thick IRS guidebooks printed on cheap
newsprint, studying every rule and regulation with the same precision he
brought to TACOM payrolls. I devoured those guidebooks alongside him,
absorbing my first lessons in accounting while watching Dad decode how
the world worked. His excitement for the logic of numbers was
infectious, each form was a puzzle to solve, each calculation a way to
help someone keep more of what they'd earned.

When my own tax time came, I followed his example, working through every
line with pencil and paper, letting the arithmetic tell its story by
hand.so did you do your neighbor’s taxes for $2 too?

Both Mom and Dad remained dedicated members of Metropolitan Baptist
Church. Under the steadfast leadership of Doctor Charles E. Morton, who
had been shepherding the congregation since August 1963, the church
maintained its commitment to worship quality and community service. But
the congregation faced an inexorable challenge, its membership was
diminishing as the children of longtime members, like me, moved away
from Detroit in search of opportunities that the shrinking city could no
longer provide.

The once-thriving congregation began to dwindle, its remaining members
aging and growing frail. Among them, most painfully for our family, was
Dad.

The Fall

Shortly after Dad's retirement in 1986, our world was shaken when he was
diagnosed with prostate cancer. The treatment, a radioactive implant and
Lupron hormone therapy, was successful, and the cancer went into
remission. For a time, we allowed ourselves to believe it was over. Dad
returned to his routines, the bowling alley, tax season, Sunday church.
Nine years of borrowed normalcy.

Then, one cold December day in 1995, Dad's life changed forever. On a
simple trip to the local K-Mart on Sherwood Street, just 2.2 miles from
home, he suffered a massive stroke in the parking lot. Shoppers watched
in horror as he collapsed, and someone quickly called 911.

I flew to Detroit Metropolitan Airport as soon as I could, rented a car,
and drove to the hospital. The antiseptic smell hit me as I walked
through the automatic doors, but I pushed it aside along with everything
else I didn't want to feel. Dad was being taken for tests. My palms were
sweaty, mind racing. As I waited, I attempted to quiet my mind, to
dissociate into the world of business by reading the one book I brought
with me, Stephen Covey's popular "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective
People."

I fought to keep my attention on the book. The world of the book was
safe, calm, hopeful.

"Seek first to understand, then to be understood."

Well, I did not understand why my Dad was fighting for his life. My hero
didn't deserve this. I found myself bargaining with a God I did not
really believe in.

Each page, just two more minutes lost. I retained nothing. I could not
focus.

Dad survived the night and the following weeks in a coma. When he
finally woke, he was paralyzed on his dominant left side and spent most
of his days in a deep, unyielding sleep. Mom stayed by his side day and
night at the hospital, her heart breaking a little more with each
passing day.

Exile

But hospital care couldn't last forever. Dad needed round-the-clock
attention, and with immense reluctance, Mom moved him to Bortz Health
Care of Warren, a facility 6.2 miles from home. The closer options were
far worse, but even Bortz was dreadful.

When Dad awakened from his coma several weeks later, he began to
understand his situation, helpless in the care of strangers, paralyzed
on his left side. With slurred speech, he eventually communicated.

"Willa, don't make a fuss. When you leave, I need these people," Dad
cautioned, his once commanding voice now soft and raspy, yet still
carrying the quiet dignity that had always defined him.

Mom understood his counsel, but she bristled under the conditions.

Visiting nursing homes had become a grim routine for our family. Every
Sunday, Dad had visited Uncle Bill when Aunt Net could no longer care
for him due to his Parkinson's disease. Now, it was Dad's turn to be
confined to one of these places.

I smelled the stench of urine, saw the understaffed facility, realized
the indignity of it all. But I processed it like data, like a problem to
be analyzed rather than a tragedy to be felt. Men and women alone in
their rooms, lying in their own waste. Mom demanded better care, but the
overworked staff were slow to respond. She did her best to clean him
before I arrived, trying desperately to preserve his dignity.

Seeing my father like this, I felt powerless. I offered money to help,
but Mom refused. She insisted they could manage and reminded me I had my
own family to care for. I was left feeling ashamed of my impotence.

Over time, Dad started to stay awake more, settling into a somewhat
normal sleep schedule. This brought its own agony; as his awareness
grew, so did his realization of his predicament. Yet, he never succumbed
to self-pity.

Ultimately, her demands for better care fell on indifferent ears.

Coming Home

Mom's heart was splintered. Her partner of 36 years was now trapped in a
broken body in a place that seemed devoid of compassion. But she had a
plan.

Determined to bring Dad home, she hired a construction company to
transform the den into a wheelchair-accessible bedroom with a private
attached bathroom, providing him with the privacy and dignity he needed.
The adjacent back bedroom, where Mom had sometimes escaped Dad's snoring
or welcomed house guests, now became her listening post, close enough to
hear every sound he made, every shift in his breathing.

Ten months after Dad's stroke, the construction was complete. Mom
equipped the room with an adjustable hospital bed, a wheelchair, and an
ADA-compliant ramp to a new back door. With everything in place, she
brought Dad home, her heart swelling with relief and determination.

Several of Mom's friends chose to warehouse their disabled husbands in
distant nursing homes. Mom did not. She modeled for me true commitment
and love. As I watched Mom's selfless dedication to Dad, I reflected on
my own selfishness, my own self-absorption. I embraced the realization,
even as I fought to avoid the depths of shame.

Mom showed me how to love.

During my visits home, the ping pong table stood silently in the
northwest corner of the basement, a reminder of times past when Dad's
quick left hand had sent balls screaming across the net. But their quiet
partnership seemed unshakeable even in these new circumstances.

Grace Under Pressure

Mom had earned a pension from the State of Michigan, and Dad had one
from the U.S. federal government. Together, they had excellent health
care coverage. However, home care was exorbitantly expensive, and their
combined pensions weren't enough to cover all the new expenses without
significant adjustments.

"We can make it," Mom would insist whenever I offered money, her chin
set in that familiar stubborn angle.

She started clipping every coupon, driving across town for sales on
adult diapers, and making regular trips to agencies that supplied free
medical equipment and supplies to the elderly and sick. The same woman
who had faithfully tithed to the church throughout her working years and
into retirement now found herself navigating the world of social
services, friends dropping off casseroles, neighbors offering to sit
with Dad for an hour.

I started tracking their finances, entering each transaction into
Quicken as I did my own, making sure that Mom and Dad had what they
needed. It gave me a safe routine to follow when I visited, something
concrete and manageable in a situation that felt overwhelming. "Derrick
is here," Mom would announce to her friends that called. "He is taking
care of my money." The pride in her voice gave me a role I could
fulfill, a way to help that didn't require me to navigate the emotional
depths I wasn't ready to face.

Dave and I started traveling to Detroit more often. I remember one time
helping Dad with a urinal, both of us avoiding eye contact, the silence
heavy with unspoken embarrassment. Later, I found myself grateful for
even that small moment of usefulness in an ocean of needs I couldn't
fill.

When I asked Mom how she got Dad to his appointments, she'd wave off my
concern.

"We manage," she'd say.

Most of the time she scheduled home health aides to assist, but on more
than one occasion she had no one to help. Yet somehow, this 4'11" woman
would wrestle Dad's 160-pound frame from wheelchair to car seat, her
body straining against his dead weight, sweat beading on her forehead as
she adjusted his legs and buckled him in. "I've got this," she'd tell
herself, even as her hands shook from the effort.

When the hospital offered a week of respite care, Mom's relief was
visible, her shoulders dropping, her smile genuine for the first time in
months. "Just one week," she'd tell Dad, kissing his forehead. "I'll be
right here when you get back."

Through the hardship, Mom created a sense of normalcy, culminating
perhaps in a 40th Wedding Anniversary party that she hosted, complete
with a sit-down formal dinner.

And she always was. Through every small crisis, every medication change,
every sleepless night when Dad's breathing grew labored, Mom remained
constant. For five years, they built a new life within the confines of
disability, Mom's commands, Dad's compliance, small victories measured
in successful transfers from bed to wheelchair. They had found their
rhythm again.

Until the cancer returned.

The Last Call

Mom and Dad found a new delicate rhythm.

"Howard, stand up."

"Howard, turn this way."

"Howard, …"

If walking were a matter of will power, Dad would walk under Mom's
demand. He never walked again on his own power, but he did stand on his
one good leg and hold himself up. Mom insisted! But in 2000, five years
after his debilitating stroke, his prostate cancer returned with a
vengeance, spreading to his lymph nodes. Mom and Dad carried the truth
like a private ache, shielding Dave and me from the weight of it.

On May 5, 2000, the façade of normalcy shattered. Mom called me with a
tremor in her voice, telling me that Dad was in hospice care and that I
needed to come home. I booked the earliest flight, my heart pounding
with each passing second. The flight was delayed, prolonging the agony
of anticipation. I finally landed at 11 PM, rented a car, and sped home,
arriving just after midnight.

When I placed my key in the side door, the door I always entered by, I
felt a stillness inside. Mom did not hear me come in. I walked to her
bedroom, afraid like I had been as a child in the dark basement. But
this wasn't the boogeyman. It was something colder, emptier. In my
heart, I knew.

I stepped inside, and silence met me like a wall. I called out, "I'm
home!" hoping to pierce the stillness. As I walked to her bedroom,
quiet, afraid, unsure if I'd woken her, the phone rang. The sound was
jarring, cutting through the stillness like a knife. I picked it up, my
hand trembling.

A nurse from St. John's Hospital was on the other end. Her voice was
gentle yet firm as she delivered the blow: Dad had just died.

The words stopped me cold. Time stilled around me. I stood there, in the
home that held so many memories. My rock, my hero. The left hand that
once guided a tax pencil and a ping pong paddle was gone.
