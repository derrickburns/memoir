Chapter 23: A Mother's Farewell

In the days following Dad's funeral, I focused my mind on tasks. I "took
care of Mom's money," as she described my bookkeeping efforts to her
friends. I helped Mom clean out her bedroom, identifying which of Dad's
clothes to give to charity, and which to discard. As I went through his
papers, I found out about Dad's prior marriage and his son. I did not
ask Mom then. Not ever. But when I read the words I suddenly realized
why Dad was so quiet about his history. He did not want to lie, so it
was better to stay silent. Mom had been grieving the slow loss of her
husband for five years. If her history of grieving Aunt Mae's death was
any guide, she would grieve for another five years... and she did.

A Life in Full

At 82, she joined a Wayne State alumni group for a trip to Egypt,
standing at the foot of the Great Pyramids with the same wonder I'd seen
in her eyes as a child when she'd point out constellations in our
backyard. The photograph she sent me showed her dwarfed by ancient
stones, her smile radiant beneath a wide-brimmed hat, arms spread wide
as if trying to embrace the world itself.

"Derrick, you should have seen the sunrise over the Nile," she told me
during our weekly phone call, her voice animated in a way I hadn't heard
since before Dad's stroke.

She described the colors, "purple and gold like nothing I've ever seen",
with the enthusiasm of someone discovering beauty for the first time.

At 85, Mom had carved out a new rhythm for herself. Mornings began with
coffee and the Detroit News, though she preferred waiting for Wednesdays
when the Michigan Chronicle arrived, savoring the community news and
perspectives that connected her to the world she'd always known. When
she backed her blue Cadillac DeVille out of the driveway, she might
scrape the chain link fence occasionally, but that never stopped her
resolve to go where she needed to go.

"Good morning Mr. Allen!" she would yell across the street when she saw
her dear neighbor of fifty years tending to his yard, her voice carrying
the warmth of decades of shared “hello”s.

Afternoons were for volunteer work at the Stork's Nest project, evenings
for long phone conversations with Mrs. Elma Peddy and Mrs. Virginia
Donaldson, friendships that had weathered decades, voices that still
made her laugh.

When friends suggested she might be "too old" for international travel,
she'd wave them off with characteristic determination.

"I've got places to see and things to do," she'd say, already planning
her next adventure.

The Call That Changed Everything

I was at my desk in San Mateo when the phone rang that January morning
in 2009. Four airline tickets to Virginia sat beside my computer, Toni
Townes-Whitley, my Princeton classmate, was hosting a party at her
compound for Obama's inauguration. I was hoping to see Michelle and
Barack there, to celebrate this historic moment with friends who had
become part of history themselves.

"Derrick?"

Mom's voice sounded different. Careful. Measured in a way that made my
stomach tighten.

"Hi Mom, how are you?"

"Well, the lymph nodes in my armpit are swollen and I have been having
trouble sleeping. I am getting a biopsy this week."

My hand tightened on the phone. Lymph nodes. Biopsy. These weren't words
that belonged in conversations with my 85-year-old mother who still
drove her blue Cadillac and yelled greetings to neighbors.

And as we held our collective breath, the news came back.

"I have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The doctors recommend chemotherapy."

The words stopped time. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cancer. Mom. The airline
tickets on my desk suddenly looked like artifacts from someone else's
life, promises of celebration that belonged to a world where my mother
wasn't sick.

"What does that mean?" I managed to ask.

"We'll figure it out," she said, her voice steadying into the tone she'd
used when I was sick as a child, as if she could will this away through
sheer maternal determination.

History could wait. Detroit was calling me home again.

The First Battle

The doctors explained the treatment plan with the practiced efficiency
of people who delivered this news regularly. CHOP chemotherapy, they
called it, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone.
The names sounded like weapons because that's exactly what they were,
chemical warfare against the cancer that had invaded my mother's body.

I flew to Detroit for her first treatment, determined to be there as she
had been there for me through every childhood illness, every scraped
knee, every fever that sent her to my bedside with cool washcloths and
worried eyes.

She was admitted to the hospital for treatment. At her age, the doctor
warned, the treatment could be difficult to tolerate. Nausea, fatigue,
even loss of balance. Mom nodded as if she were receiving a weather
report, her purse clutched in her lap as if it might anchor her to the
world she knew.

"This will help you feel better," the nurse said as she inserted the IV,
but I could see the doubt in Mom's eyes.

She had already survived breast cancer years before, fought that battle
with characteristic privacy and determination. But she was 85 now, and
her body felt different, more fragile.

The chemicals dripped into her veins with mechanical precision. Within
days, the woman who had stood at the pyramids was reduced to someone I
barely recognized. Her tiny frame was wracked with pain that seemed to
emanate from her very bones. Lethargy pinned her to the bed like
invisible weights. Her mouth became a battlefield of its own, the
treatment attacking the cells that lined her throat, making it nearly
impossible to eat or drink.

"Derrick, bring me the magic mouthwash," she whispered, her voice barely
audible.

The thick, medicinal liquid was supposed to soothe the burning, but
nothing seemed to touch the deeper agony.

When I offered her the water glass, she pushed it away with a trembling
hand.

"I'm not doing that again."

Difficult Choices

In the weeks that followed, Mom slowly emerged from the worst of the
treatment's effects. Her appetite returned in small increments, first
sips of broth, then crackers, finally real meals that she could taste
again. But something fundamental had shifted. The woman who had backed
her blue Cadillac out of the driveway with such determination now moved
more carefully, as if her body had become unfamiliar territory.

When she felt strong enough to travel, I brought her to California for a
visit. Watching her in our San Mateo home, surrounded by the life Gina
and I had built, I saw how small she looked in our guest room, how she
seemed to be measuring herself against the distance from everything
familiar.

"Mom," I said one afternoon as we sat in the garden.

"I've been thinking. What if you moved out here? I could take care of
you properly, make sure you get the best treatment."

She was quiet for a long time, her hands folded in her lap, eyes fixed
on something beyond our fence. When she finally spoke, her voice carried
the weight of a decision already made.

"Detroit is my home, Derrick. That house on Shields Street, that's where
your father and I built our life together. That's where you grew up.
That's where I belong."

I wanted to argue, to list all the practical reasons why California made
sense, better doctors, my proximity, the mild weather that might be
easier on her aging body. But looking at her face, I understood. The
house wasn't just where she lived; it was the repository of fifty years
of memories, the place where she had been a wife, mother, neighbor. If
she couldn't have her health, at least she could have the comfort of
familiar surroundings.

"I understand," I said, though part of me wanted to keep pushing.

"But you'll need help."

She nodded, that stubborn set to her jaw softening slightly.

"We'll figure it out."

The Search for Help

Back in Detroit, the reality of Mom's situation became starkly clear. I
placed an ad in the paper and simultaneously asked Mom to ask her
friends for referrals. One referral seemed perfect, but she wasn't
available to start for a couple of months. When I got a response from a
home health aide who could start immediately for just over half the cost
of the first one, I jumped at it.

Sheila was tall and strong at 5'10", with steady brown eyes and a
capable frame that suggested she could handle the physical demands of
caregiving. Her resume listed years of experience with elderly clients,
and when she spoke about her teenage son, I heard something I
recognized, the weight of responsibility, the drive to provide.

"I understand what Mrs. Burns needs," Sheila said during our interview,
her voice calm and assured.

"Dignity. Respect. Someone who sees her as a person, not just a
patient."

But convincing Mom to accept help was another challenge entirely.

"I don't need help yet, Derrick," Mom said, that familiar edge of
stubbornness in her voice.

"I can cook and clean for myself," she added.

"I know you can, Mom. I just want to make sure that if you do need help,
someone is there for you. Do this for me," I implored.

Mom grudgingly accepted the help. Just a couple of hours a day. But
those hours gave me comfort. I had a person I could call who was placing
eyes on my mom, who could tell me how she was really doing. It wasn't
the work that I valued, it was the presence.

But as Mom's condition worsened, the complexity of her care increased.
Three months after her initial diagnosis, we sought a second opinion
from an oncologist recommended by one of Mom's friends. His clinic was
modest, just an outer office with a receptionist and an inner office
lined with white cabinets that perhaps contained the drugs that might
save her.

Harsh Realities

We sat in the oncologist's inner office, Mom in the patient chair, me
beside her taking notes I hoped I'd never need to reference. The doctor
reviewed her chart with the methodical attention of someone who had
delivered this kind of news many times before.

"Tell me about the first treatment," he said, looking up from the
papers.

I found myself speaking for Mom, describing the reaction she'd had to
the chemotherapy, the dizziness that left her unsteady on her feet, the
lethargy that kept her in bed for days, the way her mouth felt like it
was on fire, making it impossible to eat or drink anything without pain.

"She couldn't keep anything down," I explained, watching Mom nod in
agreement. "The nausea was constant."

The doctor listened, occasionally making notes. When I finished, he set
down his pen and looked directly at Mom.

"Mrs. Burns," he said, his voice matter-of-fact in a way that somehow
made his words more ominous, "I can cure any cancer. The question is,
can you survive the treatment?"

The words hung in the air between us like a diagnosis of their own. I
felt something cold settle in my chest as I watched Mom absorb what he'd
just said. This wasn't about hope versus despair, this was about
mathematics. Her body versus the poison that might save it.

"What are you saying?" I asked, though I was afraid I already knew.

He explained that removing her cold turkey from steroids had been a
mistake in the first treatment. He could modify the approach, he assured
us, monitor her more closely, reduce the dosages of the harsh chemicals.
But the fundamental equation remained unchanged: the cure might kill her
faster than the disease.

Mom was quiet for a long moment, her hands folded in her lap. When she
finally spoke, her voice was steady.

"I'll try it one more time."

The Final Treatment

The modified treatment plan was administered in the sparse clinic this
time. Mom received the second chemotherapy session in that simple office
with its white cabinets and minimal equipment. When she left, I felt a
surge of hope, she was walking on her own accord, her gait steady,
looking more like the woman who had yelled greetings to Mr. Allen.

But days later, the symptoms returned. Not as severe as before, but
present nevertheless. The nausea crept back, the fatigue settled into
her bones, and the mouth sores made eating a careful negotiation between
hunger and pain.

After a few sessions, Mom made a decision that shouldn't have surprised
me but somehow did.

"I'm stopping," she told me during one of our phone calls.

Her voice was tired but resolute, carrying the tone she'd used when I
was a child and she'd made up her mind about something, final,
non-negotiable.

I didn't ask if she was sure. She had already tried twice, had already
given the treatment every chance she could. This wasn't my decision to
question or make more difficult.

"I understand, Mom," I said.

"I'd rather have fewer good days than more bad ones," she explained, her
voice carrying the same practical wisdom she'd applied to every major
decision in her life.

In that moment, I heard an echo of the woman who had refused to let Dad
languish in a nursing home, who had transformed their den into a place
of dignity and care. She knew what she wanted, and what she wanted was
to live, really live, for whatever time remained.

Fading Memories

During my increasingly frequent visits to Detroit, I began to notice
changes in Mom that were harder to dismiss than physical frailty. She
would ask me the same question three times in an hour, each time with
the genuine curiosity of someone hearing my answer for the first time.

It was simple conversation on the phone that revealed the changes most
clearly. She would talk about her day, what she'd had for breakfast, a
conversation with Mrs. Peddy, something she'd seen on the news, then
twenty minutes later, repeat it all again, word for word, as if sharing
it for the first time.

She began complaining about misplacing things. Keys that she was certain
she'd left on the kitchen counter. Her reading glasses had somehow moved
from the coffee table. Most troubling, she started hiding her precious
jewelry and what little cash she kept in the house, then forgetting
where she'd put them.

"Derrick, I can't find the Tiffany necklace you got me," she'd tell me,
worry evident in her voice. "I know I put it somewhere safe."

The woman who had managed Dad's complex medical needs with military
precision, who kept copious notes on everything from doctor appointments
to household expenses, was becoming untethered from the moorings of
memory that had always anchored her.

I took her to Henry Ford Hospital for an evaluation, sitting beside her
as doctors administered tests with names I'd never heard before. The
analysis confirmed what I had feared but couldn't bring myself to name,
significant memory loss and cognitive decline.

"It could be 'chemo-brain,'" the doctor explained, using a term that
sounded almost casual for something so devastating.

"Memory failure induced by the chemotherapy treatments."

Whatever the cause, the implications were clear: Mom's judgment was
becoming less reliable. The independence she had fought so hard to
maintain was slipping away, piece by piece, memory by memory.

Escalating Needs

Faced with Mom's declining memory and judgment, I increased Sheila's
hours, ensuring Mom had supervision throughout the day. The woman who
had once managed every detail of our household now needed someone to
remind her to take her medications, to help her find things she'd hidden
and forgotten.

At the airport, preparing for yet another delayed return to California,
I found myself making two phone calls that had become routine, once to
check on Mom, once to apologize to Gina for another postponed
homecoming. The balance between caring for my mother from across the
country and maintaining my own family felt increasingly impossible to
sustain.

By spring, our fragile equilibrium was shattered again. During a routine
examination, Mom's doctor found something that made my blood run cold, a
recurrence of breast cancer. The cancer hadn't metastasized, but it was
there nonetheless, and she elected to have a mastectomy.

The surgery itself was successful. I remember visiting her in the
hospital afterward, watching her walk down the hallway with the
temporary buoyancy that steroids can provide. She was smiling, chatting
with nurses as if nothing fundamental had changed, her spirit
temporarily lifted above the reality of what her body was enduring.

But as the steroids were gradually reduced, so was Mom's energy. The
brief spark I'd seen in the hospital corridor dimmed, and her recovery
stalled in ways that had nothing to do with surgical healing. Her body
seemed to be reaching its limit for fighting battles, and we faced
another agonizing decision.

The doctors recommended transferring her to a rehabilitation facility to
help her regain strength. I spoke with friends of Mom's, seeking their
advice. They recommended a particular rehab facility, assuring me that
it was much better than Bortz, that Mom would be well cared for. The
doctors said it was only for a couple of weeks. Mom could return home.

But even with these reassurances, the reality proved different from the
promise.

The Call Home

Two weeks into her stay, Sheila called me with alarm in her voice that
I'd never heard before.

"Your mother looks terrible," she said, her words tight with concern.

"This place is killing her."

My stomach dropped. I had trusted the recommendations, believed the
assurances that this facility would be different from Bortz. But
Sheila's voice carried the urgency of someone who had seen Mom at her
best and was now witnessing something frightening.

"What do you mean?" I asked, though I was already reaching for my laptop
to book a flight.

"She's not eating. She barely responds when I talk to her. The staff..."
Sheila paused, choosing her words carefully.

"They're not taking care of her the way she needs."

I could hear the weight of what she wasn't saying, that despite all my
research and the promises from Mom's friends, this place was failing her
just as surely as Bortz had failed Dad.

"Get her home immediately," I said, my fingers already pulling up
airline websites. "I'm coming."

When I arrived in Detroit and saw Mom, Sheila's alarm made perfect
sense. The woman who had walked hospital corridors with steroid-induced
energy just weeks before looked diminished in ways that went beyond
physical healing. There was something in her eyes, a dimming that spoke
of neglect, of being forgotten in a place where care was supposed to
happen.

That night, sitting beside her bed in the house on Shields Street, I
made a promise that felt as sacred as any vow I'd ever spoken:

"I will never send you to a place like that again. You are home now, and
home is where you'll stay."

The Final Months

I extended my visits from one week to three, spending precious time with
Mom in what we both understood were her final months. The house on
Shields Street became the place where we could simply be together, away
from the clinical efficiency of hospitals and the institutional neglect
of care facilities.

Sheila and I established a routine that gave each other breaks from the
constant vigilance that caregiving required. During my shifts, I would
keep simple meals for Mom whenever I could get her to eat. Her appetite
was barely enough to feed her tiny body that competed with the cancer
cells for nourishment.

"Mom, I am making you some oatmeal with some bananas," I'd announce.

Then I would bring it to her bedroom on a wooden tray with legs for her
to place over her lap.

We revisited her wonderful life through stories and old photo albums.
Her fingers would trace the faces of people long gone, her parents, Dad
in his younger days, me as a gap-toothed child grinning in our backyard.
Sometimes the memories came easily; other times I would gently fill in
the gaps, helping her navigate the spaces where her mind could no longer
reach.

"How is Mrs. Donaldson? Mrs. Peddy?" I'd ask, hoping to spark joy at the
mention of her dear friends.

Other times we simply sat in comfortable silence, the weight of our
shared history filling the space between us. The afternoon light would
filter through the curtains she had hung decades ago, casting familiar
patterns on furniture that had witnessed our entire family's story.

But each day, her hands grew thinner. The lymphoma had metastasized,
spreading through her body with the same relentless determination she
had once brought to caring for Dad. Sheila and I began speaking in
hushed tones when Mom napped, our conversations full of careful
euphemisms that couldn't quite mask the reality we were all facing.

One night, as I lay next to Mom in her bed, the room filled with the
familiar scents of home, lavender lotion and the faint mustiness of old
wood, she turned to me with an urgent need. Too weak to make it to the
bathroom, she needed to defecate.

I helped her to the portable folding commode we had placed next to her
bed, supporting her frail frame as she lowered herself onto the seat.
Her body felt impossibly light, as if the cancer had hollowed her out
from within. When she was finished, I wiped her clean with the same
gentle care she had once shown me as a child.

She accepted the indignity with quiet resignation, her eyes avoiding
mine not from embarrassment but from the exhaustion that came with
needing help for the most basic human functions. There was no shame in
this moment, only love expressed through the most fundamental act of
caregiving.

This was the circle of life made manifest. She had done the same for me
when I was small and helpless. I had done the same for my own children
during their countless diaper changes and potty training accidents. Now
I was doing it for my mother, the woman who had taught me that love
sometimes meant doing the things that were difficult, unglamorous,
necessary.

As I cleaned the commode and helped her back to bed, I felt the weight
of what we were sharing, not just this moment of physical care, but the
profound trust she was placing in me. In her vulnerability, she was
teaching me one final lesson about what it meant to love someone
completely.

The Last Goodbye

I returned to California to attend to my family, carrying with me the
certainty that our time together was almost over. The flight home felt
different this time, not the usual relief of returning to my own life,
but the heavy knowledge that I was leaving Mom to face her final battle
without me physically present.

When I called her now, the transformation in her voice was unmistakable.
The energy and strength that had always characterized her, what I had
come to think of as "the general" in her, was gone, replaced by an
acquiescence, an acceptance that her time was ending.

"Hi Derrick," she would answer the phone, her voice barely above a
whisper.

"Hi Mom, how are you feeling today?" I would ask, injecting as much
cheerfulness as I could muster.

"Ok," she would say, the single word trailing off into silence that
spoke volumes about her diminishing strength.

These conversations became a ritual of careful optimism on my part and
gentle resignation on hers. I would tell her about Maya and Jamil, about
work, about the weather in California, anything to keep her tethered to
the world of the living. She would listen, sometimes responding with a
soft "mm-hmm" or "that's nice, honey," but I could feel her drifting
further away with each call.

The woman who had once commanded household schedules and family dynamics
with military precision now struggled to hold onto the thread of our
conversations. Yet in her weakness, there was a kind of grace, an
acceptance of what was coming that I wasn't sure I possessed.

A week later, Sheila called.

"Mrs. Burns is gone," she said simply.

The words hit me like cold water, though I had been preparing myself for
them for weeks. Gone. The finality of that simple word seemed to echo in
the silence that followed Sheila's announcement.

I stood in my California kitchen, the phone pressed to my ear, trying to
process what she had just told me. Mom, who had yelled greetings to Mr.
Allen across the street, who had stood at the pyramids with arms spread
wide, who had fought so hard to bring Dad home and care for him with
dignity, was no longer in the world.

"When?" I managed to ask.

"About an hour ago," Sheila said softly.

"She went peacefully. In her sleep."

After I hung up, I sat down at my kitchen table and let the reality wash
over me. The woman whose strength and love had shaped everything I had
become, her voice, her laugh, her fierce determination to live life on
her own terms, existed now only in memory.

But more than personal loss, I felt something else: a profound gratitude
for those final months we had shared. For the wooden tray meals and the
gentle conversations about Mrs. Peddy and Mrs. Donaldson. For the trust
she had placed in me when she needed help with the most intimate aspects
of care. For the way she had taught me, even in her dying, what it meant
to love someone completely.

Losing Mom was like losing a piece of myself, but it was also the
completion of a circle that had begun when she first held me as an
infant, teaching me that love sometimes meant doing the difficult,
unglamorous, necessary things. Now I carried that lesson forward, along
with all the others she had given me.

The Empty House

When it came time to bid her farewell in the hallowed halls of
Metropolitan Baptist Church, the contrast with Dad's funeral eight years
earlier was stark. About sixty people attended, a modest gathering that
would have filled perhaps a quarter of the sanctuary. The church that
had once been the vibrant center of our community now felt cavernous,
its empty pews a testament to Detroit's continuing decline and the
diaspora of its children.

Doctor Morton, who had presided over Dad's funeral with such dignity and
grace, had himself passed away a year earlier, in November 2009. The
congregation that had once numbered in the hundreds during my childhood
had dwindled to fewer than a hundred faithful members, most of them
aging alongside the city itself.

A younger minister led the service, reading from notes about a woman he
had never really known. He spoke of Mom's dedication to the Stork's Nest
project, her love for her family, her strength in caring for Dad during
his final years. The words were kind and appropriate, but they felt like
echoes in a space that had once resonated with the full-throated
celebrations of a thriving community.

Mrs. Peddy and Mrs. Donaldson were there, both using walkers now, their
faces etched with the grief of losing another member of their shrinking
circle. A handful of Mom's former colleagues from the school system came
to pay their respects. Sheila sat in the back, her presence a reminder
of the final chapter of Mom's life.

As we gathered around the graveside, I thought of Aunt Mae and Uncle
John, buried next to Mom and Dad, as Mom had planned. The four plots now
filled with the bodies of those who loved me the most and who I loved
with all my heart.

After the funeral, I returned to the house on Shields Street one last
time before flying back to California. Walking through those familiar
rooms, everything looked the same, the furniture in its appointed
places, Mom's coffee cup still sitting by the sink, the Michigan
Chronicle from the previous Wednesday folded neatly on the kitchen
table. But nothing felt the same.

This house had been the center of my universe for the first eighteen
years of my life. Every room held memories: learning to tie my shoes in
the kitchen, doing homework at the dining room table, the countless
conversations with Mom and Dad about everything from school to dreams to
disappointments. Now it felt like a museum of a life that had ended.

With my own life firmly established in California and Detroit continuing
its economic decline, the family home became a burden I couldn't manage
from across the country. The house itself was in excellent condition,
structurally sound, though perhaps showing its age in ways that reminded
me of Mom herself in her final months. But maintaining it from 2,000
miles away felt impossible.

I considered whether my sister Jala might need a place to stay, but her
life was in North Carolina now. I reached out to local family members
for help. My cousin Nicole lived alone in her apartment, and I thought
perhaps she might want to move into the house. She deliberated for a
week before declining, she preferred the comfort and convenience of her
apartment, which was better located for her needs.

The house remained empty, and I felt the weight of a decision I wasn't
ready to make. This wasn't just a piece of real estate; it was the
physical embodiment of everything my parents had built together,
everything they had given me. How do you sell the place where your
family's story began?

Desperate to keep the house from deteriorating while I wrestled with
what to do, I offered to rent it to Sheila. The woman who had been Mom's
caregiver, who had called me with alarm when the rehab facility was
failing her, who had been present for Mom's final moments, surely she
would treat the house and its contents with the respect they deserved. I
thought she might appreciate having a stable place to live in exchange
for modest rent and maintaining the property.

For a time, it seemed like the perfect solution. Sheila moved in, paid
her rent, and kept me updated on the house's condition. I felt relief
knowing that someone who had cared for Mom was now caring for the home
where that care had taken place.

The following winter brought a betrayal that cut deeper than I could
have imagined. Sheila stopped paying rent and began ignoring my calls.
When she finally moved out several months later, I discovered she had
taken Mom's belongings with her, not just small items, but furniture,
jewelry, pieces of our family's history that could never be replaced.

I discovered the theft in the most jarring way possible: scrolling
mindlessly through Facebook one evening, I stopped breathing. There were
Mom's tables, the glass insets catching afternoon light, those carved
white and gold legs I'd helped Dad move so many times during my
childhood. They sat casually in someone else's living room now,
background props in Sheila's apartment photos, as if they had always
belonged to her.

Staring at that photo, rage settled like sediment in my chest. The
Tiffany necklace I had bought for Mom years earlier, the one she
couldn't find during her memory lapses, had likely been stolen by Sheila
as well. Even more heartbreaking was the disappearance of my mother's
sapphire ring, which she had promised to my daughter Maya. The woman I
had trusted with my mother's final months had been systematically
stealing not just possessions but family legacies intended for the next
generation.

The betrayal by Sheila was just the beginning of the house's decline. I
changed the locks and tried to secure the property from across the
country, but Detroit's accelerating decay made vacant houses vulnerable
targets. Despite my efforts to maintain it, squatters eventually broke
in, turning the once-peaceful home into something I barely recognized.

They bypassed the DTE meter, stealing electricity while I continued to
receive bills for a house I could no longer control. The small kitchen
where Mom had prepared countless meals, where she had taught me life
lessons over morning coffee and evening snacks, was damaged in a
subsequent fire. The scent of smoke and neglect replaced the familiar
aromas of home cooking and Pine-Sol that had defined that space for
decades.

The house was uninsured, not by choice, but because Allstate had dropped
coverage years earlier, even before Mom got sick, despite our family's
faithful and timely insurance payments for over forty years. They had
deemed Detroit properties too risky to insure, leaving us vulnerable at
the very moment we needed protection most.

Faced with mounting costs for a property I couldn't secure, couldn't
insure, and couldn't maintain from California, I made the wrenching
decision to relinquish the house to the state for unpaid property taxes.
It was the final severing of my ties to Michigan, the place where I had
been born and raised, where my parents had lived and died.

When the notice arrived from the state acknowledging repossession of the
home, I thought about Mom's hands on that front door key, fifty-one
years of turning that same lock, of coming home to the place where she
and Dad had built their life together. The house was gone, but I could
still feel her teaching me to tie my shoes in that kitchen, still hear
Dad's voice calling us to dinner from the living room.

Some things burn down. Others you carry with you forever.

Where Dad's death had driven me toward tasks and discovery, Mom's
passing left me with only emptiness. The house on Shields Street became
a wound I couldn't touch, while Marcia's death three years later would
teach me something different about loss—that some grief carries relief
alongside sorrow.

Mom Visits Our San Mateo Home, March 2010
Jamil, Mom, Maya
