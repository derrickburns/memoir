Chapter 12: Finding My Place at Princeton

Dad adjusts his camera one more time, framing the shot with the
precision he brings to everything. Behind us, Princeton's Gothic towers
rise against a perfect June sky, ivy cascading down weathered stone
walls that have witnessed countless graduations. Mom stands to my right
in her cream dress with its burst of geometric patterns: blues, purples,
bright splashes of color she chose especially for this day. She clutches
my graduation program like a treasure, her smile radiant with four years
of worry finally released. Dad, distinguished in his light gray suit,
stands with the quiet dignity that carried our family through decades of
struggle. Between them, I wear the black gown and orange hood that mark
me as Princeton Class of 1986.

The camera clicks, capturing what none of us could have imagined when
Dad first drove me through these gates. Five years that nearly broke me,
that saw me living in basements and confronting prophets, resigning from
leadership and learning to stand my ground. But here we are: vindication
in three smiles, achievement measured not just in a diploma but in the
distance traveled from doubt to this moment.

But to understand how we got here, we need to go back to September 1981,
when Dad first drove me to Princeton.

First Impressions

That first morning, Nassau Street finally appeared, dividing two
distinct realms: on one side, a quaint town devoid of familiar fast-food
joints and chain stores; on the other, Princeton University itself, a
fortress of Gothic architecture, wrought iron fences, and climbing ivy.
Despite my love of fantasy novels, this place felt pulled from a chapter
of history I'd never read. The weathered stone buildings loomed with a
gravitas that made my campus visit last April feel like a distant dream.

My late arrival to 211 Dodge Osborn Hall in Wilson College meant a
bottom bunk in a cramped quad, not the single or double rooms that the
first five of my eight suitemates had secured. Nine of us shared one
common area and one bathroom. The windows' ancient manual latches
rattled in their casings, refusing to seal completely, a preview of the
drafty nights ahead. Late arrival. Bottom bunk. Another lesson in
Princeton's unwritten rules.

Meeting Jamal

The door opened to a cramped common room where suitcases and
half-emptied boxes created an obstacle course of other people's lives.

"Hello?" I called out, my voice echoing against bare walls.

"Who's there?" A response came from the common area.

My eyes caught on a white cane with a red stripe propped against a desk.
Waiting.

"I'm Derrick, one of the new roommates."

"Jamal," he said, standing and extending his hand in my general
direction. "Welcome to the suite."

I stepped forward to shake his hand.

"You're from Michigan too, right?" I said, having been informed by the
Princeton housing office to expect and welcome Jamal.

"Ann Arbor. My Dad is a professor of African Studies there. Have you
heard of the PBS series The Africans? He created it."

"Yes! That is so cool."

Finding My Voice Through NSBE

While I navigated my academic and social footing (remedial English
despite AP successes, sidewalks where I'd yield to groups of white
students), a sign promising free pizza led me to the Society of Black
Engineers welcome meeting. What I found there changed everything.

Tonya Chisholm, class of 1982 and President of the Princeton chapter of
the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), stood before us with
quiet confidence. Her message wasn't about belonging—it was about
redefining belonging. "We don't just want to finish the race together.
We want to cross the finish line first."

Our freshman year metronome was the weekly physics quiz, and we learned
that intellect was not enough. Stamina and perseverance were required to
place first.

That March, my first NSBE Conference in Detroit inspired me. The moment
those thousand black engineering students rose to their feet, the
applause thundering off the walls, I felt the ground beneath my
assumptions crack open. From across the nation, row upon row of young
men and women—future chemical engineers, computer scientists, mechanical
engineers—were running along with us cheering, no yelling, "Nez-be.
Nez-be! NEZ-BE!"

From my seat, I could see James Raby, who would become a friend and
colleague for the next 40 years, a hint of a smile on his six-foot-four
muscular frame. Next to me, a fellow Princeton student leaned over,
shouting above the noise, "This is what they don't want to believe
exists!"

But I was not concerned about them at this moment. As Andrew Solomon
described in Far From The Tree, we were not different here. We were no
exception. We were not the "minority" that I had claimed in my
scholarship applications. We were a community, one thousand strong.

Walking back to my hotel that night, I made a decision. I wasn't going
to just participate in NSBE. I was going to lead it.

By the end of sophomore year, I was elected chapter president. I didn't
just embrace Tonya's message of excellence—I weaponized it. When I
proposed increasing the company sponsorship fee for our second annual
job fair from the prior year's $150 to $500, even our NSBE leadership
worried companies would stop coming.

"Which bike is better," I asked them, "the $150 bike or the $500 bike?"

Silence. Then Kevin Dowdell, our outgoing president, started smiling.
"You're absolutely right. We are Princeton."

The gamble paid off. The increased fees meant we could send every NSBE
member to the national conference. We weren't asking for help anymore.
We were creating our own economy of excellence.

Learning to See the Invisible

Two blocks from campus, between the engineering building and the eating
clubs stood the Third World Center. Director Czerny Brasuell ruled it, a
chain-smoking woman who reminded me of my mother's boldness in a younger
package. She taught me to see what had been invisible: the subtle
normalization of whiteness that permeated everything. A room with white
kids was "normal." A room with black kids was "a room with black kids,"
different, implicitly less than.

The way I unconsciously stepped aside on sidewalks. The invisible black
service workers in the eating clubs. Even my own compulsion to prove
myself, to leave no doubt, all of it connected to patterns Czerny helped
me recognize. Though she would later leave Princeton in disgust over the
administration's handling of a paper she co-authored on the challenges
black students faced on campus, her lessons stayed with me.

Czerny opened my eyes to these systems. Jamal gave me the courage to
act.

"MAZRUI!" became my call entering our suite.

"BURNSIE!" Jamal would respond, his face lighting up with that
infectious grin.

We were united. Young black men from Michigan, used to being
underestimated, absolutely refusing to bow to anyone intellectually.
Before exams, we'd pump each other up: "Bust it out! Write the answer
key!"

The Prophet

Jamal's mind was never sharper than the night we confronted the
self-proclaimed prophet. By junior year, this charismatic figure had
attracted a following from our class. Several of my friends had already
abandoned their studies to follow him. One evening, I convinced Jamal to
join me for dinner with this man and his disciples at the Princeton Inn,
a former hotel converted to a dorm and owned by the university that
housed many black upperclassmen.

The prophet was seated at the head of the long banquet table when we
pushed through the double doors, our dining hall plates in hand. His
followers filled in around the scratched wood surface, a table that had
endured decades of student meetings and makeshift banquets. Jamal and I
claimed spots near the far end.

The prophet's voice, practiced and rhythmic like a Baptist preacher's,
filled the space. His pale features and flowing hair seemed crafted to
match paintings of white Jesus hanging in churches across America, while
most of his disciples (my friends) were black, their trays of cafeteria
food forgotten as they leaned forward to catch every word.

The prophet's monologue flowed over us while we picked at our dining
hall chicken. His words wove promises of divine insight with hints of
secret knowledge, each phrase landing like honey on eager ears. I
glanced at Charles Vandross, a fellow engineering student and distant
cousin of singer Luther Vandross, now sitting transfixed, nodding along.
Next to me, Jamal sat perfectly still, eyes closed, head tilted
slightly, absorbing every word.

When the prophet paused for breath, Jamal's voice cut through the
reverent silence. "Could you please explain your prophecies more
specifically?" The question sounded innocent enough, but I recognized
the setup—the same tone he used before demolishing someone's faulty
logic in our late-night debates.

"I see the future as it unfolds before me," the prophet replied, his
hands spreading wide. "The signs are clear to those who—"

"What signs, exactly?" Jamal interrupted. "What specific events have you
predicted?"

The prophet's rhythm faltered. First crack in the armor.

"My followers understand—"

"So no specific predictions then?" Jamal pressed. "Just general feelings
anyone might have?"

Around the table, heads began to turn. The spell of the prophet's words
started cracking under Jamal's precise questioning. I watched Charles's
expression shift from reverence to uncertainty and perhaps to hostility
as Jamal's logic began to pierce through the prophet's vague responses.

The prophet tried to regain control, his voice rising with wounded
authority. "Those who truly seek truth will understand..."

"But you haven't provided any truth to understand," Jamal said, his
voice calm but relentless. "You've offered feelings, impressions, vague
promises. Where's the substance?"

One by one, around that scratched wooden table, I watched my friends
struggle with the revelation. The emperor had no clothes. But while
Jamal's surgical questioning had stripped away every pretense, logic
rarely overcomes faith.

Walking back to our dorm, adrenaline still coursed through my veins.
"That was incredible. Mazrui, you are the man!"

But we stopped by the Wawa Market for me to get a 16 oz. box of soft
Entenmann's Chocolate Chip Cookies, which we devoured before we got back
to our room less than ten minutes later.

"Burn-zie. Do you think I was too hard on him?"

"You tore his ass up," I said, avoiding the question and feeling just a
small bit of shame for instigating the confrontation.

The Microsoft Choice

"Interview Signups: Microsoft, Jan 1983" the sheet read. My eyes opened
wide. The company I devoured articles about in BYTE magazine was coming
to Princeton.

I'd been following Microsoft's story obsessively since they'd licensed
MS-DOS to IBM. For the generation preceding me, IBM defined computing
excellence. With this deal, Microsoft was positioning itself to become
the universal language of personal computing. Bill Gates hadn't just
purchased DOS; he'd orchestrated what would prove to be one of the
shrewdest deals in technology history. By providing MS-DOS to IBM while
retaining the rights to sell to other manufacturers, he'd positioned
Microsoft perfectly for the coming PC revolution.

This was the future being built in real time. And Microsoft was at the
center of it all.

As a sophomore, I didn't qualify for these senior-level interviews for
full-time positions, but my NSBE leadership had made me bold. If I could
convince companies to pay $500 for our job fair, surely I could convince
one recruiter to give me an interview.

"I will forward your request to the recruiter, Derrick," Director of
Career Services Minnie Reed said when I presented my case.

The call came back within forty-eight hours. Steve Ballmer would see me.

Steve Ballmer's intense gaze fixed on me across the small table. "Here's
your problem," he said. "You have a black and white picture that
contains either an orange or a banana, exactly one, fully visible.
Design an algorithm to identify which fruit it is."

As I explained how aspect ratios could distinguish between round and
elongated shapes, I saw his skepticism turn to interest. "That's...
actually a novel approach," he said. "It would work."

"One more thing. I see that you are a sophomore. This is for a full-time
job. What are you thinking?"

"To be honest, I am bored in school. I want to build things."

The offer letter arrived: full-time employment starting immediately at
$27,000 base salary, 15% bonus, stock options. But what made my hands
shake was the possibility of joining the PC revolution at its ground
zero. To paraphrase from the musical Hamilton, I wanted to be in the
room when it happens, where the future was built.

I needed to hear Mom's voice. She listened patiently as I explained the
opportunity. When I finished, there was a rare, thoughtful pause.

"Derrick, you need to finish your degree. No one can ever take a
Princeton degree from you."

Could I walk away? God I wanted to! What's the value of a degree if not
to open doors? The door was open, for Christ's sake!

I declined the offer.

Was I afraid of giving up a full scholarship and an Ivy degree? Did I
need to prove the high school "friends" who told me I would fail
Princeton wrong? Did I just feel compelled to finish what I started? Did
I fear being naked, without cover in a place very far away? Perhaps all
of those are true. Or, perhaps, what I really was afraid of was walking
away from my NSBE community!

The Fall

I started junior year as President of the Princeton chapter of NSBE and
in the spring I was elected Treasurer of the National organization.
Aside from the annual job fair, our local chapter offered peer support
that had no equivalent from the University. We were vested in each
others’ success, a far cry from the feeling that I and many of my black
friends felt of abandonment and isolation. We organized parties on
campus, often sporting over a dozen boxes of large Vesuvio’s pizza to
any and all attendees, free of charge thanks to the full coffers from
our job fair. After two years of the tutelage from master DeeJays Gary
Jenkins and Charles Anderson of Sonic Sounds, my classmates Sheila
Dooley, Joanne XXX, and Kristie Lancaster of Trice-as-Nice treated our
parties to the rhythms of hip-hip and R&B songs of Kool & the Gang,
Patti LaBelle, Ashford & Simpson, Cameo, Michael Jackson, Donna Summer,
Rick James, Parliament Funkadelic, and my favorite, Prince.

My classes were more engaging, classes in my major, upper level
economics classes with text book authors, senior advisors to the
President, and even a Nobel laureate.

I sought software project oriented courses, seeking each time to refine
my software talents to the maximum extent possible in the limits of a
ten week semester course. I poured myself into each project, setting my
bar far higher than any professor expected or fellow student would
attempt, leading my project partner Michael Kandall, a snarky Jewish
buddy from Connecticut, to say “Oh no, Burns. You are doing it again.”
When he failed Japanese because of my demands, I did not feel guilty or
remorseful. I took it as a sign of success that I had captured his
attention. Little did I know I had discovered the secret to silicon
valley startup culture!

Had I finally found my rhythm at Princeton?

A restlessness ate at my certainty. Instead of fueling my soul, the
thrill of external validation from NSBE waned as the year progressed.
Runs to Wawa Market concluded with me consuming an entire boxes of
Entenmann chocolate chip cookies before I even returned to my dorm room,
with another in hand for “later”. My campus girlfriend, if late night
rendezvouses count as such, escaped her reality with weed and, I
suspected, cocaine. If my mother had not scared me off drugs and
alcohol, our relationship would not have imploded from my constant
condescending comments about drug use.

Then I remembered.
“The Annual NSBE National Conference is coming up in March. We need to
decide how many people we can send and how to decide who gets to go.” I
said, announcing the agenda for our chapter board meeting.

I needed the kick of adrenaline that the conference would bring. I
needed the team to rally behind me. I needed to feel the energy and
excitement of 1000+ strong.

“I propose that we send every member who wants to go to the conference.
Not everyone will want to go, but I suspect that of those who do, we can
afford to send them all.”
“What happens if we get too many? I think we should prioritize members
based on their tenure and loyalty,” said our Vice-President.
“Well, if we get too many, I think we should prioritize freshman. I
think the earlier they experience NSBE, the better they will be able to
handle Princeton.” Was I talking about them, or me?

"I disagree. Travel rights to the conference must be earned. We should
only send the members who are deserving—those who've put in time to
NSBE, who've earned it."

What was going on? We had the money. Hell, I had raised it.

As I scanned the room, I could see that I did not have consensus, and
perhaps not even a majority. Was this a revolt? Where was the loyalty to
me?!

The Conference

March could not come soon enough, and when I got there I ingested the
elixir that I needed. “Nez-be! Nez-be”.
I marvelled at the leaders. As a student run organization, all the
leaders were close to my age, but I was in awe in their presence. The
speeches they gave roused the crowd. One could not resist the draw, feel
the camaraderie, and scream at the top of one’s lungs, “NEZ-BE”!

I befriended the current treasurer, Louis Hureston, a fellow
mid-westerner from Chicago who was also a Bell Labs scholar. Smooth,
calculating, and focused, Louis had a plan on how to harness the
financial resources of the fast growing organization to expand its
influence within the United States and abroad to increase the number of
culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed
professionally, and positively impact the community. I asked Louis to
support my candidacy to succeed him as national treasurer, and he
readily agreed. With his support, I won.

But when I returned from the conference, Princeton was still there,
unchanged. I slumped as the adrenaline high fell like my blood sugar did
one hour after eating all those cookies.

The words fell out of my mouth before my brain could stop them: "Fine. I
resign." The silence that followed felt like falling into an abyss.
Around the table, faces I'd considered family suddenly looked like
strangers deciding whether I was worth retrieving. The rift had torn a
hole in the fabric of my social network and my confidence as a leader. I
had felt this before. Junior achievement in high school. Yes, that was
it. I was a President without a team. I just wanted the pain to go away.

Each night, as the sugar rush wore off, I wallowed in a grief that I
could not name. I had walked away from my most cherished identity. Who
was I without the title, without the platform, without the community
that had become my identity? In the mirror, I still saw the same face,
but the person behind it felt like a stranger—someone who'd confused
leadership with belonging, achievement with acceptance. And why didn't
any of my friends ask me to stay?

For the first time since arriving at Princeton, I felt truly alone.

Summer Time

I recalled my chance to escape to Microsoft, a route closed to me now.
Following an uneventful summer with James Raby at the Richardson
Apartments of Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey with Bell
Labs housed hundreds of summer interns, I grew impatient. James had
found employment at a new startup. MaxThink occupied a few rooms in a
nondescript Bay Area office park - a world away from Bell Labs'
fortress-like Murray Hill campus. The entire engineering staff could fit
in an elevator, but what we lacked in size, we made up for in
possibility.

With several weeks to go before my senior year began, I decided to head
out to California with James. James's recommendation opened the door,
and the owner's offer seemed generous at first - $30,000 was serious
money for a college student in 1983. But I'd been reading about Silicon
Valley startups. I knew the real wealth came from equity, from owning a
piece of the dream. When I pushed for stock options, the owner's
response revealed the gulf between old and new thinking: a 20% salary
bump and - I nearly laughed in his face - a pension plan. A pension
plan? In a startup? It was like offering a savings bond to someone
looking for venture capital.

MaxThink was no Microsoft, and without equity, the opportunity felt
hollow so I returned to Princeton to start my senior year, disappointed
but wiser. MaxThink might have been a dead end, but Silicon Valley had
shown me its promise. The question wasn't if I would return, but when
and how.

Senior Year 

The train lurched out of Newark Airport, each mile carrying me closer to
an uncertain future. Through grimy windows streaked with late summer
rain, New Jersey's industrial heart throbbed past - smoke-belching
refineries and rust-belt warehouses suddenly surrendering to a pastoral
revolution of fertile farmland, neat rows of vegetables stretching
toward the horizon. At Princeton Junction, I shouldered my bags and
boarded what we affectionately called the "Dingy" - a worn shuttle that
had ferried generations of ambitious dreams to campus. Today, its
familiar rhythm felt like a funeral dirge.

The station emerged across from Wawa, and my eyes were drawn
involuntarily to Princeton Inn College, where the body of a classmate
freshman year in his dorm room had left an invisible scar on our
collective consciousness. His absence was a constant reminder: our
presence here was precarious, our grip on these ivied walls tenuous.

I walked across campus with the heavy suitcase and received my key to
the second story attic bedroom in the Third World Center (TWC) from Ms.
Sara Miller. This room was mine to inhabit in exchange for caretaking
duties. With no food plan and scant cooking skills, I joined the TWC
food cooperative, organized by fellow engineer Mike Barney, '82, our
center's emotional anchor. Mike had weathered Princeton's storms and
stayed to help others find their way. For fifteen dollars a week, he
didn't just manage our food co-op - he cultivated our community.

The TWC's heart beat strongest at lunchtime, when our food co-op
transformed the space into a family kitchen. Michelle - "Meech" to us -
would glide in, her smile lighting up the room as much as mine lit up at
seeing her. Her presence reminded us of her brother Craig, last year's
basketball captain, whose leadership had made Princeton a little more
our own. While Miche and Caroline worked their magic in the kitchen, I
happily tackled the dishes, each of us playing our part in this daily
ritual of belonging. In those moments, elbow-deep in soapy water,
listening to laughter and conversation float from the dining room, I
understood: this wasn't just a meal program. This was how we created
family, how we carved out space to be ourselves in Princeton's shadow.

The food co-op routine - Michelle's bright smile, Caroline's cooking, my
dish-washing duties - provided structure, but Czerny was gone, choosing
to leave after refusing to let Princeton sanitize her honest portrayal
of Black student life in a report they'd commissioned. Her departure,
along with her young son Jonathan who we all adopted as our younger
brother, created an emotional vacuum that I filled with sadness.

While junior year filled my need to build, senior year was to fulfill
the computer science requirements, with classes that carried no more of
my interest than freshman year remedial English. My comeuppance came
when midterm exams demonstrated that skipping class would not work very
well anymore: the lessons that I needed to learn were not in a textbook
and classmates grew weary of me borrowing and copying their notes!
Three forces converged that fall: the fracture with NSBE, Czerny's
departure, my growing impatience with theory divorced from practice.
Like tributaries feeding a river, they pulled me toward one inevitable
destination. California. James. The promise of building something that
mattered.

James welcomed me into his apartment, but when I arrived, James had
soured on MaxThink, perhaps concluding as I did that work without
ownership was insufficient. We wanted to build something of our own.
James suggested that we rebuild MaxThink.

Then I discovered it—books by Yourdon and Dijkstra that merged with
everything that Professor Greg Nelson had taught me about provably
correct code. Instead of just building a perfect piston, what if I could
build a perfect car? This wasn't just another project. This was my
destiny, my redemption, my answer to every rejection I'd ever faced. The
perfect system. The perfect code. The perfect life.

My thoughts exploded, each insight spawning three more. Sleep became an
inconvenience. I abstracted the details away, leaving a simplicity that
belies the complexity of the real world, a problem that would plague me
for decades. After failing at NSBE leadership, after struggling to focus
academically, I needed this to be the answer. I needed to prove I
belonged somewhere, that I could build something that mattered.

Days and nights blurred. I made frantic calls to anyone who would
listen—NSBE contacts, Princeton grads, job fair connections. I thought I
could sell ice to an Eskimo. I didn't hear "no." I heard "great, keep me
informed" and interpreted it as eventual "yes." I was running up James's
phone bill, talking all night, trying to make my vision so public I
couldn't back down.

"You need to stop. Take a break," James said. He wasn't angry. He was
steady, matter-of-fact. It sounded like a breakup between lovers.

When I ignored him, James made his decision: "Derrick, I think you need
to leave."

The words shattered my dream into a million shards. I knew James valued
our friendship. My community had two members, me and James.

Embarrassed and ashamed, I left the next day.

Now, I was alone.

The Basement

With no other options, I crawled back to Princeton in February, still in
possession of the keys to the doors of the Third World Center, my home
at the time I left. A closet in the basement transformed from storage
space to shelter. The basement closet smelled of industrial cleaning
solution and old concrete. At night I closed the door, stacked cardboard
boxes in rows, pulled out my blanket, and went to sleep. The cardboard
beneath me grew damp from my body heat, corners digging into my shoulder
blades. Each time I shifted, the boxes made a scratching sound that
seemed to announce my presence to anyone who might be listening above.
The concrete floor beneath the cardboard never warmed—it pulled heat
from my body all night, leaving me perpetually cold.

In the early morning, I could hear the familiar sounds above. Resident
caretakers left for class. Sara Miller arrived to support the director
of the center. Midday, members of my former food co-op arrived to make
cold-cut sandwiches between classes and returned later six nights a week
to prepare and eat dinner together. These familiar sounds were from a
life that no longer belonged to me.

I started timing the sounds above—Sara's arrival at 8:17, the co-op
lunch prep at 11:45. I was mapping a world I could no longer enter,
creating systems to understand my own exile. Even in homelessness, I was
abstracting.

I made my presence known during the day, but hid my sleeping
arrangement. The bathroom became a challenge of timing and stealth.
Showers required military precision—in before dawn, out before the
earliest risers arrived. But once dressed, I was free to roam the
building and campus. I was still a student, right?

Several weeks later, the jig was up. Center Secretary Sara Miller
approached me with the gentleness she'd always shown.

"Derrick, it has come to our attention that you are sleeping in the
basement. Is that true?"

"Yes."

"Professor Martin cannot allow that. You will need to find another place
to live. Do you need help?"

Damn. Martin is the new director of the Third World Center, replacing
Czerny who had left in frustration. The irony.

"No ma'am, I have some money. I will find a place. Thank you." I could
see the pain in her eyes. Perhaps she saw me as a struggling son; her
motherly instincts wanted to protect me.

Standing Up

I found a room for $210 a month in Kingston, New Jersey—small, with shag
red and purple carpet, but it was mine. As I unloaded my belongings from
my Bonneville, I felt something unexpected: excitement. I had $700 in
the bank. I could figure this out!

"Derrick, get a job. Burger King, wherever!" Mom counseled. Recalling my
eighteen-month minimum wage cooking job at Kentucky Fried Chicken during
high school, I said: "I hear you Mom. I will get a job, but it won't be
fast food. Been there, done that. No thanks."

Consulting work came through a newspaper ad: "Looking for software
consultants, Bell Communications Research (Bellcore)." A spinoff of AT&T
Bell Labs, I presumed I knew Bellcore culture, certainly enough to get
hired. Mr. Charles Ugwu, the consulting company owner, agreed to present
my candidacy. A month later, my first paycheck made a nice increase in
my bank account, but I wondered just how much Mr. Ugwu was getting from
my labor.

When a sympathetic secretary quietly showed me an invoice revealing my
middleman was billing $360 daily for my labor while paying me less than
half, I felt that familiar burn of injustice. But this time was
different.

The drive to his Newark apartment gave me time to think. Thirty-eight
miles of New Jersey highways to plan exactly what I'd say, how I'd
stand, what I'd do if he said no. It took me 6 gear changes to park the
car, and though there were only ten steps to the front door, each step
seemed 18 inches high. I remembered every lesson about power I'd learned
in the 'hood.

When I rang his doorbell, I breathed slowly to calm my pounding heart.
Not from fear. From clarity.

"Come in, Derrick, what can I do for you?" Mr. Charles Ugwu said warmly,
though this was our first meeting. Nigerian-American was my guess from
his name and rich dark skin. Probably in his 50s. I scanned the room:
tidy, unremarkable, the home of a man who I presumed had built his
business on the backs of younger talent. On people like me.

"Let me get to the point," I announced. "I want more money."

"You are making plenty of money. What are you doing with all that
money?" he asked, trying to deflect.

I ignored his question. "I know that you are making more per hour off my
services than I am. That is not fair."

"It is none of your business how much I make!"

"It is my business how much I make, and I demand an increase of 25%."

"No, I will just give them your two weeks' notice!" he pronounced. A
bluff. We both knew it.

This was the moment when I could accept being diminished, or I could
stand up for what I was worth. I thought of yielding on Princeton
sidewalks, of being dismissed by professors, of Pam's casual rejection
of my leadership. All those moments when I'd absorbed the blow and kept
moving. All those moments when I'd built barriers instead of standing my
ground. I'd spent years abstracting away my own worth, reducing myself
to whatever others expected.

Not this time.

"No, you will give them nothing! I will stop work immediately, but only
after I tell them how you treated me. I am well regarded there. They
know me, not you. I will guarantee that you never get another penny from
Bellcore."

I turned and walked out. My legs quivered, but I refused to show fear.
When I reached the last step, dusk was settling around me. My pulse
hammered against my ribs. I had only a couple thousand dollars to my
name, and the possibility of losing this income terrified me. But
something deeper was happening. I was learning the difference between
building walls and standing firm.

"Alright, you can have your money!" he shouted from the steps.

I kept walking, refusing even the courtesy of turning around. But
inside, a fundamental shift had occurred. For the first time in my life,
I'd stood up for my worth without compromise, without performance,
without pretense.

Return and Proving Ground

I returned to Princeton in September, having earned over $30,000. I just
needed to maintain my focus for nine months. But just after midterms
came the body blow.

"Derrick, I just got back a report on your performance. You are failing
your Industrial Organization class. If you fail you will be expelled,"
said the dean.

"The midterm was a fluke. I froze for some reason, but this material is
easy for an engineer," I said, channeling as much confidence as my
arrogance could muster. "But in any case, why would I be expelled for
failing a single class, not even in my major?"

"You are on academic probation as a result of you voluntarily
withdrawing mid-semester last fall."

"Uhhh, I thought I was on a leave of absence."

"No," the dean said firmly.
