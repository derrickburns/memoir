Chapter 29: The Diagnosis

September - First Symptoms

I had emailed Daniel, Doctor Greenwood, on September 30, 2023, Gina's
birthday.

Hi doc! I know that you are very busy, so I apologize in advance if this
is nothing…. For the last month or so I've had discomfort as I swallow
on my left side near the base of my tongue. I assumed it was from when I
had Covid Aug 22-28, 2023 but it has not gone away. Thoughts?

"Have you spoken with Daniel?" Gina asked a couple of weeks later.

"I missed his call. I will email him again today," I promised.

Nearly a month had passed since I reached out to Daniel. I
procrastinated. Scratchy throat. "No big deal," I thought. I am
constantly bothering him. I need to stop being such a wuss.

Finally, I responded to Daniel's email, suggesting anytime today or
tomorrow.

Hi Derrick, I will call you at 10:15 AM tomorrow morning. Cordially,
Daniel Greenwood

The next morning at 10:00 AM, Caller ID showed that it was Kaiser
Permanente. The call was early.

"Hi Derrick, what's going on?"

His voice carried that gentle tone he always used, the one that usually
put patients at ease. Today it made my stomach tighten.

I described the swallowing issues, trying to sound casual. "It's
probably just lingering Covid stuff, right?"

A pause. In fifteen years as my doctor, Daniel had never paused like
that.

"Hmmm. Let me ask you a few questions." The shift in his tone was subtle
but clear. This wasn't our usual friendly chat.

"Do you smoke?"

"No, never." I knew he knew this.

"How about alcohol? How many drinks? How often?"

My mouth went dry. These weren't casual questions. After all those years
asking Gina about how she diagnoses patients, I recognized what these
questions meant. These were cancer screening questions.

"Derrick, I'd like you to see a colleague of mine, Doctor Tang, in head
and neck surgery. He'll take a look at your throat. Is that okay with
you?"

"Yes," I managed, aiming for bravery but landing somewhere near
terrified.

"He has an opening on Thursday at 8:30 AM. Will that work for you?"

"Yes." I submitted, surprised that my appointment would be so soon.

After we hung up, I stood there, phone still pressed to my ear. The wall
felt cool against my palm. Three days felt like three weeks as I waited
for the appointment.

November - The Appointment

The November fog hung low over San Francisco as I pulled into the French
Campus parking lot on November 2nd. My tires crunched over scattered
eucalyptus leaves, still wet from the morning mist. I'd driven past this
building before—the old French Hospital, now a Kaiser facility. The
medical staff called it what it was: the oldest and darkest Kaiser
campus in San Francisco, a place purely functional. But today was
different. Today I was a patient.

I sat in my car, hands still on the steering wheel, watching the few
patients shuffle through the entrance. One moved slowly, shoulders
hunched. Another strode purposefully, as if walking quickly might get
him out faster.

The dashboard clock clicked to 8:22 AM. I couldn't stall any longer.

Inside immediately to my right sat the guard.

"Mornin’!" I said.

"Mornin’." he responded, with the dip of the chin that black men give to
each other that says "I see you."

I had already forgotten what floor to go to, so I scanned the directory
on the wall to the left.

"Head and Neck Surgery ... 2". Second floor. I pushed the button for the
elevator. Fifteen seconds felt like minutes. The door opened.

When the elevator door opened, I turned to the left and saw the
receptionist at her desk. Long nails! Really long nails! Eyelashes too.

As I exited the elevator, I could not help but notice how dark and
dreary it looked. Primer covered some of the walls, ready for paint. But
paint would not remake this building into a place that felt welcoming or
safe.

"Pretty nails" I said, always looking for ways to make strangers smile.

"Thank you!" she smiled. "How can I help you?"

"I am here to see Doctor Tang." I pulled out my iPhone, looking for my
Kaiser card in my Apple Wallet.

"That's ok, just tell me your name and birthdate," she suggested.

And I complied.

"Ok, have a seat and someone will be out to get you shortly."

I sat down, scanned the hall again. Desolate. Depressing. I pulled out
my phone to transport my mind away.

A medical assistant walked toward me.

"Mr. Burns?"

"Yes."

"Please follow me to the exam room."

It was a young brother.

"Whatcha think of the Warriors?" I asked.

"We will see, man. Steph and Dray need some help. But I live in Oakland.
I’m pissed that though."

"I hear you!"

The walk to the exam room was short, just ten or twenty steps. I tried
to ward off the feeling that I was walking to the gallows.

A couple of minutes later,

"Mr. Burns, I am Doctor Tang."

"Hello Doctor Tang."

"I understand from Doctor Greenwood that you have some discomfort
swallowing?" he asked.

I explained my symptoms.

"Okay, well it could be one of three things," he said confidently.
"Since you have a history of GERD, you could have irritation from
reflux. You could have an infection. And you could have cancer."

His voice didn't change. Monotone, like reading a cake recipe.

"Let's take a look. I'm going to spray your nose to numb it a bit while
I retrieve the scope."

When Doctor Tang returned carrying a sealed tray, I couldn't feel my
nostrils when I tensed them.

"First I'll take a look in your ears. I am going to place this into your
ear canal," he said.

I looked up on the screen and saw giant hairs but thankfully very little
ear wax.

"All good."

"Now let's take a look at your throat. I'm going to put this through
your nose. It should not hurt."

As he moved the scope from my ear to my nose, the monitor flashed images
of the floor. As he guided the scope up my nose, he had a difficult time
maneuvering.

"Hmm," he pulled back. "Your nasal passages are quite small. Let me get
a pediatric scope instead," Doctor Tang said as he withdrew the scope
and left the room.

Minutes later he returned. This time, the scope slid past my nasal
hairs, creating an odd tickling sensation. Not painful, just... wrong.
On the monitor, pink tissue filled the screen. I tried to decode the
images, searching for what looked normal. I saw pink and yellow skin.
Normal, even healthy-looking.

Doctor Tang manipulated the scope with practiced precision. His
confidence was reassuring, like a bomb disposal expert—skilled, focused,
waiting to find something dangerous. I could not break my attention from
the screen. I thought about the tiny camera lens and his ability to
control the scope as it snaked through me.

"Looks good," he reported.

I was encouraged, but the scope continued to move. We weren't finished
yet.

It stopped. Doctor Tang manipulated the tip, scanning the area more
carefully.

The room went quiet. Even the equipment seemed to hum more softly.
Doctor Tang raised his arm, forefinger extended, pointing at a mass.

Where there had been pink tissue, there was now something else.
Something yellowish-white. Something that didn't belong.

"Mr. Burns," he said, his tone shifting. "This is cancer, almost
certainly squamous cell cancer."

The word hung in the air between us. Cancer. My father's voice, garbled
from his stroke, echoed in my memory. My mother's eyes, tired and
imploring, reflecting the unrelenting oral pain from chemotherapy.

"Would you like to call your wife?"

I nodded, my voice trapped somewhere in my throat. As Doctor Tang
dialed, I stared at the monitor, at the mass that had been hiding inside
me. The image blurred as my eyes welled up.

"Hi Doctor Gregory-Burns," Doctor Tang's clinical voice cut through my
fog. "I'm here with your husband. I've just scoped his throat and found
what appears to be a large tumor."

"Cancer?" The word escaped me like a plea.

"Yes, this is squamous cell cancer. The tumor is large," he said,
pointing to the screen. "You will need chemo-radiation. After that, you
will see me regularly for the next five years."

My mind raced. Mom had died of cancer after suffering horrible mouth
sores from chemotherapy. Dad had died of cancer too, unable to speak and
swallow easily after his stroke. Would I be like them, in pain and
nearly mute?

I told Gina I would call her later.

"Do you need me to come there?" she asked.

"No, thanks. I will call you later," I responded, summoning the
strongest voice I could muster.

Doctor Tang explained the next steps: biopsy to confirm diagnosis, CT
scan to measure size, PET scan to check for metastasis.

"If it has spread to your brain or liver, then there is nothing we can
do."

When he offered to do the biopsy immediately, my body made its decision
before my mind could catch up. Sweat beaded my forehead, my throat
closed tight.

"I can't do this now. I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble."

Doctor Tang's expression softened slightly. "Don't worry about that, Mr.
Burns. I understand completely." He reached for his phone. "This is
Doctor Tang. I have a patient who needs an immediate throat biopsy. Yes,
today. It can't wait."

Can't wait. The words echoed in my head. Doctors don't rush unless... I
pushed the thought away.

"They can take you at 3 PM. Will that work?"

Six hours. From diagnosis to surgery in six hours. "Yes," I heard myself
say.
