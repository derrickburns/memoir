Chapter 13: Understanding My Path 

Arrival at Stanford (Fall 1986)

The drive from Detroit to Stanford in August 1986 was more than a road
trip, it felt like stepping out of one life and into another. My father
rode beside me in Mom’s old '78 Bonneville as we watched the streets of
my childhood recede in the rearview mirror. Those neighborhoods weren’t
just familiar, they carried a sense of identity, of community, that I
was leaving behind without knowing what might replace it.

I arrived at Stanford with a fire in my chest: I was going to earn a PhD
in two years, just like Professor Robert Tarjan had done under the
guidance of Donald Knuth. To me, that wasn’t just an impressive academic
feat, it was a map. Tarjan’s work in graph algorithms was already
foundational, and Knuth’s influence on the analysis of algorithms was
unmatched. Their ideas had shaped the field I loved. I wasn’t just
pursuing a degree, I wanted to contribute to that kind of legacy.

But Stanford had its own rhythm, and I soon realized the typical
dissertation takes seven years to complete. The department was
world-class, yet I often felt adrift. At Princeton, I’d had a strong and
supportive Black community; at Stanford, I struggled to find connection.

Weekends gave me some relief. My friend James introduced me to his
circle from Cal, University of California at Berkeley, and that group
became my lifeline. We played pickup basketball, gathered for poker
nights, and hit up Silks nightclub in Emeryville. These were small
escapes, but they mattered.

Our game nights, held in modest apartments, were a kind of ritual,
filled with laughter, takeout, and endless conversations about where our
lives were heading. We played Guts, a high-stakes card game that
demanded nerve and intuition. Every hand pulled me back to Detroit,
where reading people quickly had been second nature.

Still, beneath the camaraderie, a deeper kind of loneliness crept in. I
was learning that academic challenges were only part of the journey. I
was also rebuilding a sense of belonging, one piece at a time.

It wasn’t until later that year that I heard Tarjan had won the 1986
Turing Award for his work on graph algorithms. The Turing Award was the
highest recognition in our field, and knowing I had studied under
someone of that caliber made the goal feel real, even if distant.It felt
like a signpost, confirmation that the path I admired truly led to the
summit. Theoretical Foundations (Winter 1986)

Four months after arriving at Stanford, I found myself in an intimate
research seminar led by none other than Donald Knuth, who had been
Tarjan’s mentor and who had won the Turing himself back in 1974. Being
in his classroom felt both inspiring and daunting. Seated at a long
table with some of the most brilliant theoretical computer science
students of my generation, my dreams of Silicon Valley briefly faded,
replaced by a more immediate concern: keeping up.

This wasn’t the collaborative, affirming environment I’d read about in
Ebony profiles of Black tech pioneers. This was theory at its purest and
most unforgiving. My practical instincts, the same ones that had served
me so well at Princeton, suddenly felt insufficient. At the head of the
table, Knuth sat quietly, eyes sharp, while an open research problem
hovered in the room like both a challenge and a test.

The seminar space was stark. No computers, no distractions, just a long
wooden table and our notepads. It reflected the essence of Knuth’s
philosophy: clarity through precision, solutions forged from first
principles. Breakthroughs were meant to happen here with pencil and
paper, and when they did, they were typeset in TeX, the elegant system
Knuth had designed himself to express mathematical thought with perfect
fidelity.

The problems he posed weren’t from textbooks. They were raw, complex,
and often unsolved. The first time I read through one of his
assignments, I could barely understand what was being asked. Concepts
like Stirling numbers were completely new to me. My year of
graduate-level study under Robert Tarjan had given me confidence with
graph algorithms, but this level of abstract mathematical analysis was
unfamiliar territory.

What surprised me even more was that I wasn’t alone in feeling lost. As
we went around the table, it became clear that others were just as
bewildered. This wasn’t a room full of students breezing through elite
math, it was a room full of smart, capable people learning to navigate
the unknown together.

That first problem set the tone for the rest of the seminar. We weren’t
expected to memorize or apply known results. We were asked to explore
the unknown, to test ideas, and to learn from each other. We tackled
each problem over two weeks, inching forward together. My contributions
to the first two assignments were small. I mostly watched, tried not to
fall behind.

Then came the third problem, graph algorithms. At last, familiar ground.
I dove in with renewed energy. That night, under the steady glow of my
desk lamp, I filled pages with diagrams, reductions, and half-finished
proofs. By dawn, I was exhausted but exhilarated. I had something real.

Walking across campus to Terman Engineering, I ran into Tomas Feder, my
Argentinian classmate. Excited, I shared my approach. As I explained, I
saw a flicker of understanding in his eyes, not awe, but recognition. In
seconds, he extended my ideas, skipping over entire steps to arrive at a
more elegant, far-reaching solution, solving not just the problem I had
focused on, but others I hadn’t yet seen.

His ease left me stunned. Back in Detroit, I’d taught myself programming
and calculus. At Princeton, I’d held my own. But here, watching Tomas
work was like watching a grandmaster play chess while I was still
figuring out how the pieces moved. His brilliance was effortless, almost
casual, and it shattered the tidy narrative I’d been carrying, the one
that traced a steady arc from inner-city striver to Ivy League success.

Still, I hadn’t failed. These were open problems, and the real measure
wasn’t whether we solved them but how we thought about them, and how we
worked together. When grades came in, I received an A+.

Despite that success, I remained unsure of my place in the world of pure
theory. I had shown I could contribute, especially on familiar ground.
But my encounter with Tomas had revealed something deeper: the
difference between competence and genius. As winter gave way to spring,
I continued my coursework, quietly wondering whether theoretical
computer science was truly where I belonged. With summer approaching, I
started searching for opportunities that might point me toward a clearer
path.

Silicon Graphics Opportunity (Summer 1987)

After my intense introduction to theoretical computer science, the
summer of 1987 arrived like a blast of fresh air, reconnecting me to the
world I'd first glimpsed in those inspiring Ebony profiles. At Silicon
Graphics (SGI), I found what theoretical computer science couldn't
offer, a place where practical innovation mattered more than academic
pedigree. Doctor Marc Hannah, a fellow BLESP scholar and co-founder of
SGI, represented everything I'd aspired to become: a Black pioneer
turning theoretical insights into real-world impact.

Stepping into SGI's bustling offices, I discovered a culture that
celebrated creativity and collaboration over abstract theory. The energy
was infectious, 600 employees jammed into spaces built for far fewer,
generating an atmosphere of constant, enthusiastic innovation. The
company seamlessly blended work and play: basketball courts outside,
foosball tables in the break rooms, Friday beer busts, and lavish annual
parties featuring top music headliners. Everything at SGI was structured
to keep talented minds engaged and collaborative rather than isolated
and competitive.

My officemate Vince quickly evolved from colleague to mentor, expanding
my world beyond mere technical pursuits. Through him, I discovered
excellence wasn't confined to algorithms and coding, it encompassed fine
dining, impeccable attire, disciplined workouts, and meticulously brewed
espresso. Vince's guidance helped me see professional growth as
holistic, blending cultural sophistication with technical skill. Our
late-night coding sessions often turned into expansive discussions,
bridging worlds from East to West, engineering to culture, and refining
my Detroit-born sensibilities.

Our team focused on fundamental challenges in computer graphics,
transforming complex mathematical surfaces into beautifully rendered
visuals. Collaborating with Vince, Doctor Rosemary Chang, Doctor Tom
Davis, and Henry Moreton, I quickly found my niche.

My project addressed the "trimmed patch problem" in computer-aided
geometric design. Complex curved surfaces in 3D models are represented
mathematically as patches, but accurately rendering these surfaces when
trimmed, for instance, to create car windows or holes in mechanical
components, is notoriously difficult. The algorithms I developed offered
a novel method for accurately and efficiently rendering these trimmed
surfaces. Seeing our approach flawlessly render the famous Utah teapot,
complete with intricate cutouts, was a transformative moment, validating
months of dedicated effort. It crystallized a vital lesson: genuine
innovation arises from combining practical skills with theoretical
insights. This wasn't mere academic exploration, our automotive industry
clients depended on this technology to visualize their designs,
transforming my theoretical algorithms into vital industry tools.
Eventually, this work became the cornerstone of my dissertation.

Rosemary, thirteen years my senior, taught me the fundamental
mathematics behind creating sophisticated graphics algorithms. Henry,
already seasoned from his tenure at Schlumberger and his graduate
studies at Cal, shared invaluable practical insights. Under their
mentorship by day and through intensive study by night, I discovered how
my programming skills, merged with their profound theoretical
understanding, could solve previously intractable problems.

Despite flourishing at SGI, the allure of academia persisted. The
theoretical computer science community embodied a form of excellence I
wasn't ready to relinquish entirely.

When our SIGGRAPH paper was rejected, I initially felt the familiar
sting of academic disappointment, but this rejection was different. At
SGI, setbacks were part of the creative journey, not judgments of worth.
My colleagues' supportive reactions illuminated what academia had
lacked: a culture valuing contribution over immediate perfection,
iterative improvement over flawless initial attempts.

Doctor James "Jim" Winget personified this practical excellence. Like
Tomas Feder at Stanford, Jim possessed immense intellectual depth, yet
his brilliance extended beyond theory, demonstrating how profound
theoretical knowledge could address real-world problems. Jim's
mentorship offered a compelling model of success, one where
understanding and application coexisted seamlessly.

Yet, the academic aspirations of matching intellectual feats with giants
like Robert Tarjan lingered. Memories of how Mike and I had once
outperformed Princeton's brightest, independently rediscovering
solutions known only to Professor Tarjan, continued to fuel my scholarly
ambitions.

As summer concluded, I returned to Stanford invigorated yet internally
conflicted, torn between the collaborative, practical world of industry
and the rigorous, theoretical demands of academia.

The Theory Qualifying Exam Crisis (Fall 1987 - Spring 1988)

Returning from the energizing summer at SGI, I quickly faced another
crucial test, the theory qualifying exam. As winter quarter approached,
the qualifying exam dominated every conversation in the graduate student
offices on the fourth floor of Margaret Jacks Hall. Stories from
previous years, whispered rumors about its difficulty, only amplified
our collective anxiety. This exam wasn't merely a test of knowledge, it
determined who belonged in Stanford's theoretical computer science
program and who didn't.

To prepare, Alex methodically filled notebooks with practice proofs,
while David thrived in his new academic direction. Unlike them, and
reminiscent of my electrical engineering courses at Princeton, I had
little genuine interest in this level of mathematical detail. I aspired
to the elegant intellectual world inhabited by Professor Tarjan, where
proofs reflected brilliant insights into structure rather than tedious
derivations. Yet, much like an overweight person promising to diet
"tomorrow," I continuously procrastinated, always vowing to start
studying seriously the next day.

The qualifying exam was a grueling, week-long ordeal, a take-home test
allowing unrestricted access to textbooks and papers. Similar to my
economics final at Princeton, this moment tested more than just my
knowledge; it assessed my fundamental sense of belonging. Unlike
Princeton, where I'd confidently claimed space in the classroom,
Stanford found me shrinking into the background.

The take-home format intensified my struggle. For seven agonizing days,
I sat surrounded by stacks of reference materials, confronted by
problems that mocked my inability to grasp their elegance. The open-book
freedom emphasized my deeper issue, it wasn't about memorization or
access, but a profound mathematical intuition I feared I lacked.
Mathematics, like professional athletics, demanded consistent practice
and dedicated training. I had invested in neither, and my shortcomings
became painfully evident.

Each evening left me staring at unsolved problems, blank pages mirroring
my growing panic. My old Detroit instinct surfaced, never show weakness.
Yet Stanford was not Detroit or Princeton, and my usual defenses failed
miserably.

When Professor Knuth eventually published the exam solutions, they were
concise, masterful proofs composed by students, primarily by Tomas
Feder. His solutions, crafted effortlessly during the same week of my
struggle, displayed clarity and sophistication I found unattainable.

The exam results delivered a crushing blow: I had failed. Alex, despite
months of insisting he wasn't ready, passed with quiet competence. The
truth I'd tried to avoid shattered my carefully built defenses, passion
for elegant algorithms wasn't sufficient. Theory required mathematical
maturity, something I'd forfeited by abandoning advanced math at
Princeton to prioritize practical programming. That seemingly reasonable
decision now haunted me.

My academic disappointment bled into every facet of my life. Calls home
dwindled as I dreaded explaining my failure to parents accustomed to my
success. Pride and shame trapped me in isolation. The fourth floor of
Margaret Jacks Hall transformed into a gauntlet of anxiety. Its dingy
graduate student offices, worn carpets, and oppressive fluorescent
lights seemed suffocating. Navigating these halls meant carefully timing
my visits, yet sudden encounters were inevitable. Colleagues quickly
averted their gazes, sharing my discomfort. My failure hung silently in
the stale air between us.

Each day deepened my isolation, making the already dreary fourth floor
darker and more confining. The maze-like corridors, previously a shared
academic home, became oppressive and intimidating, each turn threatening
another awkward interaction. My failure had seeped into the physical
space itself, embedded in each scuffed carpet tile and flickering
fluorescent bulb.

While academic theory had left me isolated and inadequate, I began
contemplating whether another path might better align with my strengths
and aspirations.

FOCS Conference Epiphany (Fall 1988)

The personal toll of my academic struggle had become undeniable. One
Sunday morning, as I shaved, I barely recognized the exhausted, drawn
face staring back at me. My mother's gentle inquiry during our weekly
call, "Are you doing okay?", held a quiet concern that I couldn't simply
brush off. Something had to change, not just for my academic future, but
for my overall well-being.

Despite failing my theory qualifying exam, I wasn't ready to entirely
abandon my theoretical ambitions. At SGI, my meticulously maintained
collection of recent Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) and
Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) proceedings remained my
pride and joy. These publications symbolized my aspiration: to write
papers that earned me a respected place within these prestigious
conferences. When Bellcore funded my trip to FOCS in Chicago, I packed
the latest proceedings like a talisman, reminiscent of the way I'd
prepared books for my first day at Detroit's most prestigious high
school years earlier.

Upon arrival in Chicago, I registered eagerly and immediately acquired
the new conference proceedings, full of anticipation. However, the
reality of the conference quickly shattered my expectations of
collegiality and acceptance. As I navigated through the halls, clutching
the latest proceedings like a protective shield, I again encountered the
invisible barriers that had long marked my academic journey. Attendees
clustered in tight-knit groups, exchanging insider references and jokes.
My attempts at conversation were met with polite yet distant silence.
Once again, I found myself an outsider looking in.

Yet, this rejection felt distinctly different. During breaks, while
sitting alone and pretending to study the proceedings, I experienced a
moment of profound clarity. Although familiar pain lingered, I suddenly
understood something essential, I had convinced myself that I wanted to
become a theoretician without fully comprehending the cultural realities
of academia. Observing the conference closely, it became clear to me: if
this was what academic success meant, it wasn't for me.

This realization was unexpectedly liberating. The problem wasn't a lack
of capability; rather, I'd been measuring myself against standards that
didn't align with my true strengths or values. Walking back to my hotel
that evening, I felt lighter, freed from the weight of expectations that
didn't reflect who I genuinely was or wished to become.

Chicago’s streets seemed brighter, the evening air fresher. For months,
I'd carried the heavy burden of perceived failure. Now, I recognized
that what I'd failed at wasn't necessarily what I was meant to succeed
in. While theoretical computer science had undeniable value, my true
talent lay in bridging theory and practical application, as I'd
experienced at Silicon Graphics. This wasn't giving up; it was
discovering my authentic direction.

Pivot to Systems (Winter 1988 - Summer 1989)

Armed with newfound clarity from the FOCS Conference, I began exploring
systems with a determination previously reserved for theoretical
computer science. After my epiphany at the FOCS Conference, I found
myself at Stanford's engineering library at 11 PM, surrounded by stacks
of systems papers. The building was nearly deserted, save for a handful
of dedicated graduate students hunched quietly over their desks. My lamp
cast a focused circle of light onto Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson's
original Unix papers as I scribbled notes in the margins.

I traced the evolution of operating systems, from MIT's CTSS through
Multics to Unix, observing how each generation refined the lessons of
its predecessors. The elegant simplicity of Unix's "everything is a
file" philosophy transported me back to my first summer at Bell Labs in
Naperville, where I had marveled at the powerful combinations achievable
through a few simple commands. I vividly recalled learning to chain
grep, sort, and awk through careful study of examples in Unix's manual
pages, transforming data effortlessly, tasks that would have taken me
days manually.

"It's the same elegance," I murmured to myself, realizing for the first
time how deeply Unix’s principles had unconsciously shaped my
programming style. Initially, I'd appreciated Unix purely for its
practicality; now, I began to see and admire its underlying
architectural beauty.

In stark contrast to my earlier procrastination with theoretical
concepts, I approached systems with genuine enthusiasm and eagerness. I
compiled a detailed reading list and methodically immersed myself, often
staying up late into the night, unable to consume the papers quickly
enough. Each paper built logically upon the last, shaping a coherent
mental model of how large-scale computing systems functioned. Thompson's
"The UNIX Time-Sharing System," Lampson's "Hints for Computer System
Design," the Berkeley Fast File System paper, I devoured them all
passionately, driven by genuine curiosity rather than obligation.

The difference was transformative. Theory papers had frequently left me
feeling bewildered and discouraged, whereas these systems papers
resonated deeply with my practical experiences. Discussions about
operating system architectures brought back memories of the layered
design in Xinu, reminding me vividly of the challenges of running it on
real hardware. Process scheduling discussions triggered recollections of
writing assembly language for the 68000 processor. Trade-offs in
programming language design evoked memories of the compilers I'd built
during my time at Princeton. These weren't mere abstract theories; they
were concrete solutions to challenges I'd personally encountered.

I studied alone, without study groups or practice sessions. I didn't
know anyone else preparing for the systems exam simultaneously, yet
unlike my isolated struggle with the theory exam, I felt no fear or
loneliness. This was my comfort zone, where each concept connected
naturally to hands-on knowledge I already possessed. Reading about
virtual memory management wasn't an abstract endeavor; it recalled
tangible experiences dealing with actual memory constraints on real
machines. File system optimizations were not theoretical puzzles but
practical responses to real performance bottlenecks.

On the day of the exam, I entered the room with a newfound confidence
absent during my theory exam. When I read the first question about file
system design trade-offs, it wasn't an intimidating abstraction, it felt
like engaging in a meaningful conversation about real engineering
decisions I understood intimately. Comparing Unix's i-node structure
with alternative approaches, I found myself writing enthusiastically,
driven by genuine excitement rather than academic obligation.

Integrated Identity (Summer 1989)

Passing the systems exam provided a tangible sense of achievement and
validation, yet it also highlighted a new set of challenges. Passing the
systems exam on my first attempt felt less like a surprise and more like
validation. The results arrived quietly in my department mailbox, a
simple sheet with check marks indicating success across every section.
Standing in the hallway of Margaret Jacks Hall, the same place where I
had grappled with imposter syndrome just months earlier, I now held
tangible proof that I belonged, at least in the systems world.

Yet, the path forward remained uncertain. My theory advisor had been
denied tenure, and because I'd immersed myself so deeply in theoretical
computer science, I had neglected to build relationships with any of the
systems faculty. I'd been so focused on fitting into the theory
community that I'd overlooked connections with professors whose
interests aligned more closely with my own strengths.

But what initially seemed an obstacle quickly became a catalyst. Through
my work at SGI, I'd cultivated a professional network and discovered a
colleague who was also an assistant professor at Stanford. As I weighed
my options, a simple yet powerful possibility took shape: could my
practical work at SGI become the foundation of my systems dissertation?

I approached him with this idea clearly outlined: my algorithms were
fully implemented, already used by real customers, and with my full
fellowship, I required no financial support. He readily agreed to become
my advisor.

Could it really be that simple? The irony wasn't lost on me. After years
of struggling to conform to academic expectations within theoretical
computer science, my path forward emerged not through academic channels,
but industry connections. The same practical work I'd initially pursued
as an escape from academic pressures was now the key to academic
advancement, on terms that highlighted my strengths rather than my
shortcomings.

Reflecting on my journey, I saw that moving from theory to systems
mirrored my broader transition from Detroit to Silicon Valley. Each
shift demanded adaptation; each new phase required growth. Most
importantly, each challenge had clarified where my particular talents
could make the greatest impact.

I thought back to the Black pioneers I'd admired in Ebony magazine, Marc
Hannah, Roy Clay, Ken Coleman. They had carved out their own paths,
often outside traditional academic frameworks. True success, I realized,
wasn't about meeting someone else's definition of excellence, but about
finding a path where my authentic self could thrive.

As the summer of 1989 approached, clarity about my professional identity
finally emerged. I wasn't destined to be another Robert Tarjan; my path
was uniquely mine, integrating theoretical insights with practical
innovation. This realization brought not disappointment but relief. I
stopped striving to be something I wasn't and embraced who I truly was:
someone capable of bridging theory and practice, making theory practical
and practice principled.

Standing on Stanford's Quad, a profound sense of peace settled over me.
The campus that once represented a theoretical ideal was now just one
milestone in my evolving journey toward meaningful contribution. The
failure I'd once feared had ultimately catalyzed a more genuine, lasting
success.

What I didn't yet know was that this newfound professional clarity would
soon be mirrored by equally transformative developments in my personal
life. But that story was still to come.

Act II: Searching
