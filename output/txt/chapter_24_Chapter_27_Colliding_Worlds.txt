Chapter 24: Colliding Worlds

The Invitation

When his imposing 6'2", 300-pound frame filled the doorway of the
funeral home, the chatter in my mind about the people I recognized and
those I did not came to a sudden halt. My focus narrowed completely to
my uncle. I had only seen him in person a few times before, always on
his turf, restaurants in Michigan, his haunts, not mine, where he moved
with the easy confidence of someone who belonged. But now he was here,
on mine?

"I came to show my respects," he'd said simply, pulling me into an
embrace that felt both foreign and familiar. "On behalf of the family."

The family. Marcia's family. The other family. The family I'd discovered
at thirty-three but never quite figured out how to integrate into the
life I'd already built. David's presence was his way of saying I see
you. You belong to us too. But as he held me, I felt a door open, though
it would be three years before I walked through it.

Now, twenty-four hours later, as we prepared for Mom's funeral at
Metropolitan Baptist Church, I found myself bracing for another
collision. Marcia had called to say she was coming.

Before the Service

The morning of the funeral, I stood in my childhood bedroom, the same
room where Mom and I knelt down to pray, where Dave and I snuggled
together, where I'd hidden in the closet. I stood in front of the mirror
attached to the back of the dresser, confirming my appearance as I had
every Sunday before going to Church. I adjusted my tie, the tie Dad had
taught me how to don in front of this very mirror.

Gina was busy getting herself ready after getting up early to make a
full breakfast for us. Maya at age 20 and Jamil at 18, were dressed,
quietly bracing themselves for the event that they knew was coming, but
at their age they could never be ready for: seeing their grandmother in
a casket, never to hear her call their names again.

“My-er!"

"Ja-meeel!"

"Coming grandma" they'd respond.

When I walked out of the bedroom, I barely noticed the kids. Maya's eyes
were puffy and red. Jamil walked gingerly.

"Mom, when do we need to leave the house?" Maya asked.

"In about 15 minutes. We will go directly to the cemetery from the
church, so bring your gloves. I don't know how long we will be outside."
Gina instructed, always thinking ahead to the needs of the family.

Not me. I was locked in my own head, barely functioning as an adult, let
alone as a parent. I just needed to drive us to the church. Back out of
the driveway, turn west onto Stockton a few blocks, make a left onto
Ryan Road, drive past the warehouse where Dave could have lost his
freedom when his friends killed a cop.

Driving down Ryan Road between McNichols and Davison in the 1970s, you'd
see tall, narrow two-story homes packed tightly together, each with a
deep front porch where families sat, kids played nearby, and the scent
of cut grass or barbecue drifted through the air. The houses, mostly
wood-framed with worn siding and high gabled roofs lined up like
sentinels just feet from the sidewalk.

Today, that same stretch of Ryan Road is a ghost of its former self,
most of the houses are gone, replaced by vacant lots overrun with grass,
weeds, and silence. Where once there were porches full of life, now
there's mostly open space, the occasional lone house clinging to its
foundation, surrounded by emptiness and memories.

The life of that street is gone.

As we pulled into the church parking lot, I found myself remembering the
only time both my mothers had been in the same space in Detroit, that
July 4th celebration in our backyard thirteen years earlier. Mom had
insisted on showing Marcia my baby pictures, a gesture layered with
meaning. Look what I raised, it seemed to say. Look at the boy who
became a man in my house. But there had been something else in Mom's
eyes that day, maybe recognition, maybe pity for the woman who had given
birth but couldn't mother. They had barely spoken, but something had
passed between them. An acknowledgment of the impossible situation we'd
all inherited.

Now Mom was gone, and Marcia was coming to claim her place in my grief.
But which place? What right?

The Collision

We climbed the steps to the main church entrance, an entrance that we
had rarely used before. Like the front door entrance to my home, this
entrance was sacred, official. Raising my leg to climb each step was an
ordeal, as if I were carrying an eighty pound backpack. I looked down,
planted one foot at a time and pushed. I might as well have been alone,
for I was detached from all other humanity.

Metropolitan Baptist Church looked exactly as it had throughout my
childhood, the warm wood tones, the familiar scent of furniture polish
and aged hymnals. Mom's casket sat at the front, surrounded by
arrangements of pink and white flowers mixed with Zeta Phi Beta blue.
The sanctuary was maybe a quarter full, a painful reminder of Detroit's
decline and the diaspora of families like ours.

We made our way down the center aisle, one I’d only rarely walked as a
child while collecting offerings as an usher. Mom never sat in the
center; she always chose the far-right side. Jala led Joshua and Maya
into the first pew, then Jamil, Gina. I took the end seat, closest to
the casket and nearly centermost in the room.

My eyes locked on the casket, Mother’s casket, the one I’d ordered
online like I was shopping for a television. She would’ve approved:
modest, decorative, dignified. From where I sat, I couldn’t see her
face, though I had when we walked in. It was wrong. Her eyes closed,
makeup off, something missing. This wasn’t my mother. My mother was
gone.

The Wake at Funeral Home, December 2010
Mom

The minister began the service, and I tried to focus on his words about
Mom's life of service, her dedication to family, her strength. But the
minister did not know Mom, and his words felt flat to me. As a recent
addition to Metropolitan which had struggled to find a new spiritual
leader since Doctor Morton passed, he did now know my mother. He did now
know her fifty years of service. My attention kept drifting back to that
casket, to the wrongness of everything about this moment.

People filtered in behind us. I could hear the soft shuffling of feet,
whispered condolences, the rustle of programs.

Then I heard shuffling in our row coming from the right. It was Marcia.
Her expression was flat. No. Not flat. I could see her stealing herself.
Holding it together, not unlike her visit to Mom's house. This was Mom's
house too, after all, not hers. But like that first meeting, this one
was not optional, and she summoned the strength to walk into this
church, this black church, where she was the only white face.

What am I supposed to feel right now? The question crashed through my
mind as I watched her settle into the pew. Relief that she came?
Resentment that she's here? Gratitude that she cares enough to honor
Mom's memory?

The gesture was bold, presumptuous, and heartbreaking all at once. Here
was a woman claiming her place in a family constellation that had never
quite had room for her. At that moment, I saw not the complicated woman
who had cycled in and out of my life for thirteen years, but someone who
had lost the right to publicly mourn her own child. Someone who had to
assert her claim to grief.

She gave birth to me, I thought, but in this room, surrounded by people
who knew me as Willa Burns's son, what does that mean?

Marcia sat down next to Maya, as Maya, perhaps unconsciously, recoiled.
The tears started streaming down Maya's face again, as Jamil joined in.
Both tried to face forward, tried to brave the torrential flood that
rushed at them. Gina stiffened as well, perhaps only noticeable to me.
Or was I projecting? I don't know, can't know. The sanctuary was empty,
just the five of us and ... Mom. At least Mom was at peace, beyond the
reach of the flood of emotions that sought to knock us all down.

The minister continued his words about Mom's life of service, her
dedication to family, her strength. But part of my attention remained
fixed on the impossible geometry of that front pew. Maya trying to
control her tears while unconsciously pulling away from the stranger
beside her. Jamil's shoulders shaking with fresh sobs. Gina's tension
radiating through the space between us. And Marcia, rigid and present,
claiming space in grief she had no roadmap to navigate.

Am I Willa's son or Marcia's son? The question felt urgent, blasphemous.
Can I be both in this sacred space? Do I owe Marcia recognition of her
loss, or do I owe Mom protection of her memory?

But mostly, I just stared at that casket and tried to make sense of a
world where my mother was gone.

The Breaking Point

When the minister invited people to come forward for the final viewing,
we rose as a family. I walked to Mom's casket first, my legs still heavy
as if carrying that eighty-pound weight. As I walked up to the casket, I
was performing the role of strong, honorable, dedicated son. I escorted
my family up. I showed my wife and kids who had not grown up in the
church how to pay final respects. I did not cry. It was like when Mom
told me to go get a switch. I turned off emotionally, and simply
performed the task at hand.

I looked down at her peaceful face one more time, trying to memorize
every detail beyond the wrong makeup, beyond the stillness that wasn't
her. The hands that had bandaged my scraped knees. The voice that had
called "Derrick!" when dinner was ready. The woman who had claimed me
completely when another woman couldn't.

As I returned to my seat, a strange numbness settled over me. It felt
like watching myself from outside my body, performing the rituals of
grief while my mind tried to process the collision happening around me.
When other mourners filed past, Mrs. Donaldson leaning heavily on Kenny,
church members offering whispered condolences, I responded
appropriately, but felt disconnected from it all.

Then I saw Marcia approaching the casket. She stood there longer than
most, and I found myself wondering what she was thinking. Was she
thanking Mom for raising the child she couldn't? Apologizing for the
intrusion? Saying goodbye to the only other woman who truly understood
the impossible situation we'd all inherited?

When Marcia returned to the pew, I watched as she approached my
children. Maya sat with tears still streaming down her cheeks, trying to
be strong. Jamil had his head in his hands, lost in the kind of pure
grief that eighteen-year-olds feel, devastating and complete.

"Jamil, I'm so sorry about your grandmother," Marcia whispered, reaching
toward him.

But Jamil didn't look up. Lost in his own world of grief, he gave no
sign he'd heard her. He was drowning in the loss of the woman who had
made him feel special, chosen, loved unconditionally.

As Marcia reached for Maya, she stiffened, her instinctive recoil
pronounced. To her, this was still a stranger offering comfort in a
moment when all she wanted was the grandmother who would never call her
name again.

And that's when I saw it, the moment when careful family choreography
collapsed into raw human confusion. Maya's obvious discomfort. Jamil's
complete withdrawal. My children had no roadmap for this relationship,
no script for how to receive comfort from someone they barely knew who
claimed a place in their grief.

I never taught them how to be Marcia's grandchildren, I realized,
because I never learned how to be Marcia's son.

The recoil lasted only seconds, but it felt like hours. I watched
Marcia's face flush with embarrassment and hurt. I watched my careful
compartmentalization, keeping my birth family and chosen family in
separate spaces, collapse in real time.

Marcia straightened, her lips tightening, and returned to her seat
without another word. The rest of the service passed in a blur of hymns
and prayers, but I could feel the tension radiating from that front pew
like heat from a furnace. The emotional numbness that had carried me
through the viewing deepened, wrapping around me like armor.

This is what happens, I thought, when you try to belong to two families
that were never meant to meet.

After the Storm

The ride to the cemetery was silent except for the soft sounds of
ongoing grief. Maya stared out the window, her confusion written across
her face. Jamil remained lost in his sorrow. Gina held my hand, her
touch the only thing that felt real. I found myself thinking about
protection, how Mom had protected me from questions I wasn't ready to
answer, how Gina had tried to protect my children from relationships too
complicated to navigate, how Marcia had tried to protect herself from
another rejection.

But you can't protect people from the truth, I realized. You can only
delay the collision.

At the graveside, I thought about the four plots Mom had purchased years
earlier. Uncle John and Aunt Mae already rested there, the aunt and
uncle who had loved me unconditionally, who had never questioned my
place in their family. Soon Mom would join Dad beside them. Four people
who had claimed me completely when claiming was what I needed most.

This is my family, I thought, looking at those headstones. This is where
I come from, regardless of who gave birth to me.

But even as I thought it, I felt the weight of Marcia's presence behind
me. She belonged here too, in some way I couldn't quite define. She had
given me life, and that life was now being buried alongside the woman
who had shaped it.

The minister said the final words. We threw dirt on the casket. And then
it was over.

Marcia approached me one last time as people dispersed.

"I'm sorry for your loss," she said formally, as if we were strangers.

"Thank you for coming," I replied, equally formal.

We stood there for a moment, two people who shared blood but not
understanding, connected by grief but separated by everything else. Then
she walked away, and I didn't know it would be three years before I saw
her again.

Recognition

In the days that followed, as the sharp edges of grief began to dull
into a persistent ache, I found myself thinking about that moment in the
pew differently. Maya's recoil hadn't been cruelty, it had been honesty.
She had responded to a stranger in a moment when she needed the familiar
comfort of family. Jamil's withdrawal hadn't been rejection, it had been
the self-protection of a teenager overwhelmed by loss.

But I also began to understand something else. Watching Marcia that day,
seeing her face flush with hurt, I recognized something I'd felt
countless times myself, the sharp sting of rejection, real or imagined,
and the defensive lashing out that followed. The same hypersensitivity
to perceived slights that had marked my own relationships. The same
desperate need for belonging coupled with the defensive expectation of
abandonment.

We both carry wounds that never properly healed, I realized. We both
struggle with feeling secure in relationships.

The irony wasn't lost on me that the very traits that might have helped
us understand each other were the same ones that kept driving us apart.
Two people damaged by the same trauma, circling each other warily, each
waiting for the other to provide what we'd never learned to give
ourselves.

When Marcia's letter to Maya arrived a week later , harsh words about
Maya's behavior and our failings as parents, I read it with a familiar
hollowness in my chest. The pattern was so predictable it felt scripted.
I couldn't even muster anger. I just felt tired. Tired of the endless
cycle of tentative connection followed by explosive rejection. Tired of
watching my children become collateral damage in a drama that had begun
before they were born.

Standing in Mom's church that day, watching my children respond with
honest emotion while the adults around them performed their careful
emotional dance, something had shifted inside me. I realized I could no
longer sustain the hope and disappointment that had defined my
relationship with Marcia. My children deserved better. I deserved
better.

The door between us didn't slam shut; it closed quietly, with a
resignation born of exhaustion rather than anger. Sometimes love, no
matter how earnestly desired, simply isn't enough to bridge certain
divides. And sometimes, the kindest thing we can do for ourselves and
others is to acknowledge that painful truth and learn when to walk away.
