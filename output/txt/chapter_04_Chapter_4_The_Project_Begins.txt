Chapter 4: The Project Begins

Half-day kindergarten posed a problem for two working parents. Each
morning at seven, Dad left in his sport coat and tie for TACOM, the Tank
Automotive Command of the US Army in Warren, about six miles away. Mom
followed shortly after, heading to McDowell Elementary School where she
taught Special Education.

After Mom dropped me at Atkinson Elementary, I'd spend my mornings
learning letters and numbers. At noon, Cille—our combination babysitter
and housekeeper—would make the short walk to collect me, carefully
navigating us past the Sojourner Truth projects and around Krainz Park.
We always stayed on the park side, dodging broken glass and weeds that
pushed through the cracked sidewalks.

"Cross your legs Indian-style," Mrs. Parker would say. "Look at the
board. What letter is this?"

"B!" I'd call out, eager to please.

"Very good, Derrick!"

To Mom's delight, I earned gold stars regularly. When summer arrived,
she had plans to ensure there would be many more.

Summer School

When your mother is a teacher, you learn quickly that education never
ends. Teaching other people's children paid the bills, but teaching her
own child—that was her calling.

"Derrick, come to the kitchen table."

Mom only had one leadership style: directive. While other children spent
the summer before first grade riding bikes and chasing fireflies, our
kitchen table transformed into something that looked suspiciously like
school.

She spread workbooks across the pad of the dining room table like a
general planning battle strategy. I studied the neat stacks of books and
papers. Through the window, children's voices mixed with the hum of lawn
mowers and the distant melody of the ice cream truck—a world I was no
longer part of.

The lessons followed the same pattern each day.

"Do these words first." Cat. Dog. Run. Jump. Words I already knew, but
Mom demanded perfection.

“Finish the page”.

My pencil felt heavy as I carefully formed letters in the spaces she'd
prepared, Mom monitoring every stroke.

But cursive proved the real battle. The letters had to connect
perfectly, flowing together like Mom's pristine handwriting. My W's
never matched hers.

"No, like this." She demonstrated on her own paper. "Do it again, to the
end of the row."

By day's end, my hand cramped and my shoulders ached. But her smile when
I succeeded made every moment worthwhile. When Mom was proud of me, the
world felt right.

Mrs. Blanding's Classroom

I entered Mrs. Blanding's first-grade classroom that September feeling
like I possessed secret powers. While other children stared at their
books with wide, uncertain eyes, I already knew most of the words.

"Who can read this sentence?" Mrs. Blanding asked, pointing to the
chalkboard.

My hand shot up before anyone else's. I knew the answer. I always knew
the answer.

When she distributed our math workbooks, I flipped through the pages.
Page ten, twenty, thirty—I'd seen these problems before. Mom owned the
same books.

"Mrs. Blanding, I already completed these," I announced, pointing to the
first chapter. "Can I work on the harder problems?"

Mrs. Blanding looked surprised. "Derrick, we start at the beginning.
Everyone learns the same way."

But I didn't want to repeat the elementary problems. At home, Mom had
taught me addition that made my classmates stare in amazement. I could
write in cursive while they still printed their letters. I finished
assignments before Mrs. Blanding completed her instructions.

"Derrick, slow down," she'd say. "Check your work."

But I was too excited to slow down. I knew I was smart. Mom had told me
so all summer long.

Mrs. Blanding's Note

The note came home on a Tuesday. Was I in trouble?

I handed it to Mom when she returned from work, studying her face for
clues. Her lips pressed into that thin line I'd learned to recognize—a
warning sign whose meaning remained unclear.

Mom read the note twice, her finger tracing each line. When she
finished, she folded it carefully and headed straight to her bedroom.

"Virginia, I just received a note..." I heard her say before she closed
the door. Mrs. Donaldson was Mom's closest friend, her confidante and
most trusted advisor.

I paced between the bathroom near Mom's bedroom and the den, trying to
decode what I'd done wrong. Had I talked too much? Made too many
mistakes? The muffled sound of her voice carried through the door, but I
couldn't distinguish the words.

Later, Mom emerged to prepare dinner. She said nothing about the note.

The next morning, while Mom showered, I crept into her bedroom and found
the note on her dresser. I couldn't read all the words, but I understood
enough: Mrs. Blanding was complaining that I already knew everything.
She wanted Mom to stop teaching me at home. The word 'mistakes' jumped
out at me—Mrs. Blanding said I was making mistakes by rushing.

I folded the note exactly as Mom had left it, my heart pounding. No
wonder Mom looked angry.

The next day, she came home late.

"Derrick, come here," she commanded.

I walked to her bedroom, my stomach tight with worry.

"Tomorrow you'll report to Principal Malinoff. You're no longer in Mrs.
Blanding's class. You'll be in Mrs. Bridget's class."

"I don't understand. Did I do something wrong?"

"No. Mrs. Blanding isn't teaching you properly. Mrs. Bridget will do a
better job."

Walking to Second Grade

Principal Malinoff escorted me to Mrs. Bridget's classroom. When we
entered, students' eyes moved between us like spectators at a tennis
match.

"Stand here, Derrick," Principal Malinoff instructed, walking to Mrs.
Bridget to whisper something in her ear.

"Class, this is Derrick Burns. He'll be joining us for the rest of the
year," she announced. "Derrick, take that seat."

Every eye in the room focused on me. I scanned their faces and found
Glenn Burch's familiar grin. Glenn lived around the block from me.
Seeing his friendly face, my shoulders relaxed.

"Hey Derrick!" Glenn whispered as I claimed my seat. "How'd you get in
here?"

"Quiet!" Mrs. Bridget commanded, her tone reminding me of how Mom
controlled her classroom.

For the remaining months, school ceased to bore me. Mrs. Bridget spoke
faster, expected more, moved through lessons as if she assumed we could
keep pace. And I could. All those summer sessions with Mom had prepared
me for exactly this.

When I brought home my first second-grade worksheet crowned with a gold
star, Mom's face illuminated like Christmas morning.

"Excellent work," she said, pulling me into her embrace.

In her arms, I felt warm and significant. All the hard work, the
repetitive lessons, the times I'd wanted to play outside instead of
learning—everything had been worth this moment.

Sunday Performance

Though pleased with my classroom instruction, Mom didn't reduce my home
education. Her teaching extended far beyond school. As director of
Metropolitan Baptist Church's "Primary Church"—the program for children
too old for nursery but too young for the main sanctuary—she established
curriculum and teaching schedules.

Some of the teachers of Primary Church were public school teachers like
Mom, but most were just parents volunteering to help. Mrs. Davis played
the out-of-tune upright piano while we sang “Jesus Loves the Little
Children”—words I belted out enthusiastically, especially when Mary was
in the classroom.

Mary was my cousin and best friend, though not really my cousin. We'd
been play cousins so long I couldn't remember when it started. She lived
on the West side with her little sister and father. I never knew what
happened to their mother—I'd heard she was white. Uncle Bubba and Aunt
Mildred, who lived behind us, were Mary's relatives too. Mom instructed
me to address them as aunt and uncle, though they weren't really family
either.

Mary's father often dropped the girls at Uncle Bubba's house, just as
Mom brought me to Aunt Mae's. Those were magical days—Mary and I played
hide-and-seek and talked endlessly. Which created problems, at least
according to Mom.

"Derrick, stop that talking!" Mom commanded at Primary Church.
Embarrassed and frustrated, I complied... temporarily.

"Derrick, what did I tell you about talking?" Her eyes blazed, her jaw
tightened. This wasn't a question.

"Derrick, go sit over there."

In the car afterward, Mom announced my fate: "When we get home, fetch me
a switch."

The Price of Excellence

Even as I basked in the golden warmth of Mom's pride over my
second-grade triumph, I was figuring out how our family really worked. I
was learning to read a more complex language—the grammar of conditional
love. Being smart illuminated Mom's face with joy, summoned her pride,
caused her affection to pour over me like sunlight. But
deviations—talking without permission, playing with food, hesitating
before following her directives—cast shadows that felt like a Detroit
winter.

The lesson crystallized with the clarity of revelation: smart meant
loved. What felt like choice in those tender years would calcify into
compulsion, defining the next four decades of my existence.
