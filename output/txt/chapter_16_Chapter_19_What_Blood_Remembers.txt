Chapter 16: What Blood Remembers

Unearthing the First Fragments

"That's ME!"

The words nearly escaped my lips as I stared at Marcia Rosenberg's face
in the 1958 Mumford High yearbook. After thirty-three years, I finally
saw someone who shared my blood. But this moment was only the
culmination of a journey that had begun years earlier, with a simple
question.

When Mom forwarded me the March 22, 1990 letter from the Detroit Probate
Court detailing an interview with my birth mother at Florence Crittenton
Hospital, my throat tightened as I unfolded the pages. The report
revealed two startling truths: I was born to a Jewish woman and a black
man in 1964 Detroit, a product of two distinct cultural traditions that
had somehow found each other across racial boundaries rarely crossed in
that era.

I read and reread this description of my birth father:

She said he was born in 1938 of Negro parentage in Michigan and reared
in the Episcopalian faith. He is described as a 6' 2" tall young man,
slim, and very good looking, and altogether very personable. He is said
to have friends and, as noted above, his achievements are outstanding.
He presently feels very rejected by his mother. He is the only boy in
the family. He has an older sister.

After completing high school he enrolled at a prestigious white
university out-of-state and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts cum laude.
He subsequently completed his law degree at another prestigious
university. He is presently in private practice.

As a Princeton graduate who grew up in Michigan, I correctly translated
"prestigious white university out-of-state" to mean an Ivy League
university. But I missed a crucial clue in the next line. "Another
prestigious university" did not mean another Ivy League school. The
writer had specifically mentioned "out-of-state" for the undergraduate
degree but omitted it when describing the law school, a detail that
would prove decisive years later.

The Legal Maze and the Cost of Searching

Between 1990 and 1997, I pursued this quest without the benefit of
online databases, often leaving my wife and young children behind for
law library research sessions in Redwood City or trips back to Detroit.
On weekends, I shifted from writing complex code at work to combing
through legal directories, two tasks requiring the same exacting focus.
Guilt weighed on me as I recognized I was approaching this personal
quest with the same analytical rigor I applied to coding, often at my
family's expense.

Maya arrived on October 11, 1990, and Jamil followed on November 5,
1992. Even as my family expanded, questions about my own origins haunted
me.

"Do what you need to do," Gina told me one evening, her silhouette
framed in the doorway as I gathered my notes for another law library
expedition. Her words registered, but little else. Blinded by obsession,
I missed the quiet resignation and weariness crossing her face, a burden
she carried silently. The pull of potential discovery eclipsed the
impact of my absence.

"What will you do if you find him?" she asked once, looking up from a
medical journal.

"I just need to know," I said, my voice catching slightly.

She studied my face for a moment, then nodded, understanding something I
couldn't yet articulate.

"Then keep looking."

Her hand squeezed mine briefly before returning to her reading.

Looking back now, I finally see that Gina's support never wavered,
though it surely came at a cost invisible to me then. The same woman who
navigated the pressures of being a black female physician somehow
carried our family's emotional weight as well, supporting my search with
strength I didn't fully appreciate at the time. My obsession with
finding my past left me unable to see the sacrifices happening right in
front of me.

All my life, I'd navigated questions about my light skin, straight hair,
and hazel eyes, only to discover that my heritage was more complex than
I'd imagined. The discovery of my Jewish maternal lineage didn't alter
my black identity, but it illuminated why I never quite fit the
categories others imposed upon me.

I'd spent my life like a puzzle piece that didn't quite fit in any box,
edges too rounded here, too sharp there, only to discover I belonged to
a different puzzle altogether.

I came to understand later that there had been unconscious connections
all along, at Princeton, most of my closest friends had been either
black or Jewish, a pattern I'd never examined until learning about my
birth mother. The irony wasn't lost on me that I'd grown up feeling
disconnected from humanity, like "an alien," when I actually had
connections to two groups who understood what it meant to be
marginalized while striving to maintain their identity and dignity.

For a person who had grown up fielding constant questions about "what" I
was, this report wasn't just data, it was affirmation. The ambiguity
that had followed me through childhood playgrounds and college campuses
wasn't a mistake; it was a deliberate combination of specific people
with specific histories.

Later, my birth father's sister would ask, "Why didn't you search for
your birth mother first?" The question haunted me because I had never
even considered searching for my maternal side first. The choice to seek
my paternal lineage had been instinctive, like a compass needle swinging
north, responding to a magnetic pull beyond conscious thought or
decision. Perhaps because I'd grown up in a black family, finding my
black birth father felt like finding the biological connection to the
cultural identity that felt like home.

ALMA: A Path Through the Labyrinth

Discovering the Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association (ALMA) stirred
the same excitement I'd felt years earlier when I found the Bell Labs
scholarship. Founded in 1971 by fellow adoptee Florence Fisher, ALMA was
one of the earliest and most vocal advocates for adoptees' rights in
America.

What moved me wasn't the discovery of other adoptees, I had known many
throughout my childhood. What struck me was finding a movement, a
collective voice demanding change. Here were adults like me who had
grown up loved and cherished, yet still felt entitled to know their
origins.

As I reviewed ALMA's materials, I gained perspective on why finding my
birth parents had been so difficult. My birth in 1964 had placed me at
the center of multiple colliding social forces, during a moment when
adoption practices were beginning to shift but hadn't yet transformed.

Michigan's adoption laws created what advocates called a "donut hole"
period, affecting adoptees born between May 28, 1945, and September 12,
1980. While adoptees born before or after this period could access their
original birth certificates unless a birth parent explicitly objected,
those of us caught in this window faced a different reality. We needed
each birth parent to have proactively filed a statement of consent with
the Central Adoption Registry, or we'd need to pursue a court order, a
bureaucratic mountain designed to be nearly impossible to climb.

ALMA's lobbying efforts revealed crucial changes to Michigan's adoption
laws, particularly Section 710.27, which defined "recognizable
information." The law created an absurd paradox: requests for records
must not reveal personal details, yet were required to disclose all
non-identifying data.

This revelation led to an important insight, the report I'd received in
1990 couldn't be the original document, as it was printed in a modern
typeface. Someone had retyped it, raising the question: what hidden
details might the original document contain that had been deemed too
identifying to share?

The Breakthrough After Years of Silence

By late 1995, the landscape had shifted. Maya had started kindergarten,
her backpack almost too big for her small frame, while three-year-old
Jamil constructed elaborate block cities in the living room. Their
growing independence created space for me to reignite my search with
renewed determination.

Throughout my search, the three thousand miles between California and
Michigan created a particular rhythm to how I shared my progress with my
parents. Dad, whose quiet strength had always been my north star, would
often ask, "Any news about your search?" His question came as a genuine
interest in this chapter of my life.

What I appreciated most was how Dad never made me feel that my search
reflected poorly on him as a father. His questions weren't tinged with
insecurity but with the same curious intelligence he brought to
everything. These brief affirmations, coming across the phone line in
his familiar baritone, carried surprising weight.

During my visits to Detroit, these long-distance exchanges would
transform. Sitting in the living room where I'd grown up, I'd sometimes
catch him watching me with an expression I couldn't quite define, not
concern, exactly, but a quiet assessment. In those moments, I realized
that Dad was witnessing my search not as a rejection of my upbringing,
but as an extension of the independent thinking he and Mom had always
encouraged.

Mom's approach was different. She rarely revealed vulnerability, and my
intuition suggested that her brave suggestion to search stemmed more
from a sense of parental duty than personal desire. Her pragmatism had
always been her strength and her shield, and I found myself protecting
her emotions just as she had always protected mine. Their unspoken
support allowed me the freedom to search without the burden of their
feelings, a final parenting gift I only recognized years later.

By September 1995, I had renewed my search with fresh determination.
Over the next year, a frustrating dance with bureaucracy ensued. Letters
and meetings with officials at the Probate Court led only to polite
responses that my "social file" was lost. After exhausting standard
avenues, I decided to pivot. Presuming my birth father practiced law in
Michigan, I reached out to Mr. Edward J. Littlejohn, the historian of
the Wolverine Bar Association, in November 1996.

Then on January 4, 1997, the unexpected happened. Ms. Evanski called
with news that a copy of my social file had been recorded at the Family
Independence Agency. She offered to request a copy and forward it to me.

The envelope arrived on January 23, 1997, thin, official, unassuming. I
held it for several minutes before opening it, running my fingers along
the sealed edge. This ordinary paper might contain the key to
everything. Finally, with an unsteady breath, I tore it open and
unfolded the pages, revealing a copy of the long-missing social file.
Although all names were redacted, the names of schools were included:

…had graduated from Harvard College in 1960 and the University of
Michigan Law School in 1963.

The Discovery and the Void

A jolt of recognition ran through me. I immediately called Mr.
Littlejohn to share the new findings. A month later, on February 24,
1997, he faxed me a list of seven names and their academic credentials.
Among them, only one person matched all the criteria: William Burton
Golden, whose educational background perfectly aligned with every hint
from my social file. Here, finally, was the name I had been seeking.

For the next two days, I returned to the legal directories with renewed
purpose, methodically scanning for William Burton Golden. To my growing
frustration, I found no trace of him. The elation of discovery gave way
to confusion, how could a Harvard graduate and University of Michigan
Law School alumnus simply vanish from legal records?

Then a possibility I had never considered in all my years of
investigation suddenly dawned on me, what if he was no longer alive?

With trembling fingers, I navigated to the Social Security Death Index
on February 26, 1997. My heart already knew what my mind refused to
accept. There it was, William Burton Golden had died on May 18, 1971, in
San Rafael, CA. He had always been "Burton" to his family, not William,
a detail that explained why he had eluded my searches for years.

My stomach clenched, lungs emptied, as I stared numbly at the date on
the screen: May 18, 1971. I had been robbed of possibility before
knowing it existed. The shock was visceral, like being punched by an
invisible fist. I had been seven years old when he died, still
collecting matchbox cars and playing in Aunt Mae's yard, completely
unaware that death had already sealed a door I hadn't yet discovered
existed.

What hit me hardest wasn't just that I would never meet him, but that I
had been robbed of even the possibility without knowing it. Years of
searching, only to find... absence. Permanent and irrevocable.

But ghosts leave traces. William Burton Golden had lived. He had family.
He had a story. And somewhere in that story was the beginning of mine.

Traces of Ghosts and First Contact

When I called Mr. Littlejohn back, my voice was steadier than I
expected. The news of William's death had changed everything, and
nothing. I still needed to know.

Two days later, on March 3, 1997, Mr. Littlejohn faxed me an
autobiographical sketch written by James R. Golden, William's father. A
cold ripple passed through me as I held the paper. Here was something
tangible, words written by my grandfather about his son, my father. Then
came another revelation: William's sister, Mrs. Phyllis Butler, was a
practicing lawyer in Detroit. Mr. Littlejohn provided her work address
and phone number.

The pieces of the puzzle were falling into place, and the truth that had
eluded me for so long was finally within reach. I stared at Phyllis
Butler's phone number for a long time. This woman, my aunt, might not
even know I existed. She had lived her life in Detroit, practicing law,
while I grew up just miles away.

Now that I knew the identity of my birth father, I was faced with an
unexpected conundrum. What was it that I truly sought?

My quest had evolved into something much deeper. Despite the boundless
love and support from my family, I felt a persistent sense of being an
"other." I was Derrick, an individual in a world where everyone else
seemed to belong to a collective. I had no photographs of people who
looked like me, no stories of ancestors to share.

Searching for my birth parents was like archaeology of the self,
carefully brushing away decades of dust to reveal fragments of a
forgotten civilization that somehow produced me.

Determined to fill this void, I reached out to my Aunt Phyllis by phone
on March 5, 1997. "Hello, my name is Derrick Burns. You don't know me,
but I have some news to share with you. I am your late brother's son."

Phyllis was understandably shocked and confused. "Is this a prank? Are
you mistaken? Why are you calling me?" she asked, her voice tinged with
disbelief. Realizing this wasn't the right time or place, she gave me
her home phone number so we could talk more privately later.

During our second call, Phyllis confessed she knew nothing about her
brother having a child. She speculated that perhaps I was the son of his
girlfriend Susan, a white woman she remembered from those days.

I explained how I had uncovered the identity of her brother. I told her
about my loving upbringing, my happy family with my wife and two
children, my Ivy League education, and anything else I could think of to
reassure her. I wanted her to know I wasn't after anything from her.

But deep down, I knew that wasn't entirely true. I did want something
from Phyllis, though I couldn't quite articulate what it was. It
certainly wasn't money; our careers provided comfortably for our needs.
It wasn't love either. I had "wonderful loving parents," without a hint
of sarcasm.

During our third call, Phyllis's demeanor abruptly shifted to hostility,
her voice edged with suspicion born from years of fiercely guarding her
family's past. "Why are you looking for your father? Most people seek
their mother!" she snapped.

Phyllis's hostility stung, but I sensed beneath it a deeper fear, an
instinctive guarding of family legacy. Her comment about seeking my
mother struck a chord. Why hadn't I thought to look for my birth mother
first? It had seemed natural to seek out my birth father, someone I
identified with as a well-educated, presumably successful black man.

Nevertheless, it seemed this path was a dead end. Phyllis made it clear
she didn't trust me or my motives. But even as she tried to shut the
door, I detected something in her voice, guarded, but not fully closed,
that suggested she wasn't done thinking about me. Questions clearly
nagged at her: "Who was this young man who had reached out?" "Could he
actually be a son of her deceased brother?" The uncertainty lingered,
and with it, a thin thread of possibility.

First Connection

My black lucent Merlin phone lit up at 7PM, an unusual hour for an
outside line call.

"Hello, may I please speak to Derrick," the caller asked.

"This is he." "This is Karen Butler. I believe that you spoke to my
mother Phyllis Butler."

"Hello Karen!" I said excitedly.

After my interactions with Phyllis, I had thought my quest had ended.

Her voice carried a warmth that contrasted sharply with her mother's
defensive tone during our calls. Where Phyllis had been guarded, Karen's
words flowed with genuine curiosity.

I later learned that Karen's decision to call hadn't been simple.
Phyllis had mentioned our conversations to her daughter almost as a
warning, be careful of this stranger claiming to be Burton's son. But
Karen, analytical and fair-minded like the attorneys in her family,
approached the situation differently. 'I thought you deserved at least a
conversation,' she would tell me years later. 'Whatever the truth was,
shutting the door completely didn't seem right.'

We met at Fishbones, a restaurant in Greektown that Karen had suggested.
I arrived twenty minutes early, claiming a corner table where I could
watch the door. My palms were damp despite the air conditioning. What if
we had nothing in common? What if the connection I sought wasn't there?

When Karen walked in, time dilated. She navigated between tables with
confident grace, scanning faces until our eyes locked across the crowded
room. Something clicked instantly, not quite recognition, but an uncanny
familiarity, as if meeting someone I'd known in a forgotten dream. Her
light skin and curly hair reminded me not of myself, but of the girls I
had found attractive during my adolescence. The ironic realization that
she was "my type" made me chuckle inwardly, a bullet dodged indeed!

Our conversation that evening flowed with surprising ease. We discovered
shared interests that went beyond coincidence. The ease with which we
fell into intellectual rapport felt both strange and natural, we were
strangers with the unconscious rhythms of family.

What struck me even more was the discovery of our overlapping social
worlds. As we talked about Mercy High School, where she had attended, I
realized we knew many of the same people. For the first time, I felt a
bond with people who thought like me. Here was tangible proof of my
intellectual roots, a family of analytical minds spanning generations.

That evening with Karen transformed my understanding of what I had been
seeking all along. Beyond medical histories and biographical details, I
had yearned for this precise feeling, recognition of self in another,
the experience of intellectual kinship that went beyond mere genetic
connection. As we parted that night, I realized I had found something
more valuable than facts: I had found living proof that my analytical
mind hadn't emerged from nowhere but had roots in a lineage I was only
beginning to discover.

Our relationship developed gradually over the following years. We
settled into a rhythm that suited us both, occasional phone calls,
holiday cards, and sporadically shared family news.

Uncovering My Father's Life

Through Karen and later conversations with Phyllis, I learned that my
father had married a concert pianist named Althea Robinson. They had
twin daughters, Angela and Jennifer, born in 1969. I had two
half-sisters, one living in New York City near her mother and
stepfather, the other teaching at Phillips Andover Academy in
Massachusetts.

In April 1997, during a sabbatical from my job at Silicon Graphics, I
decided to reach out to Althea. I wrote her a letter, and she called me
a few days later. Our conversation was warm and open. She seemed
genuinely pleased to hear from me and said she had much to tell me about
Burton and his family when we could meet in person. She mentioned that
Burton had been "treated" at the time of his death, a hint at
circumstances I would learn more about later.

I planned a trip to New York City during my sabbatical to meet Althea
and hopefully my half-sisters, though Karen had told me they weren't
ready to meet me yet. Before my trip, I had sent an email to Angela at
PC Magazine where she worked, but received no response.

The Other Half of My Story

Meanwhile, my thoughts began to turn toward finding my birth mother. I
had her birth date (April 13, 1941) and those of her two siblings from
the social file. I also knew that her mother was born in Detroit. From
the interview copy I received in January, I was able to deduce the
number of letters in her first and last names.

I posted these facts to an internet mailing list of adoptees. Most
responses were well-wishes, but one stood out. Daryl Royal from
Dearborn, Michigan, who had also been born at Crittenton Hospital,
suggested I examine the Detroit Legal News for birth notices of my birth
mother and her siblings. He explained that back issues could be found at
the Detroit Public Library.

On April 21, I began a 10-week sabbatical from Silicon Graphics,
originally planning to work on home repairs and my dissertation.
Instead, I found myself drawn into two life-changing pursuits:
interviewing with Virage for a much-needed career change, and finally,
seriously searching for my birth mother.

With my days free from corporate demands, I could fully dedicate myself
to the search. Gina supported me wholeheartedly but worried about what
it might stir up emotionally.

"Just be prepared for anything," she cautioned one night, her eyes
meeting mine over her cup of tea.

"People have complex reasons for the choices they make."

Discovering My Mother's Face

The moment I landed in Detroit, I felt a strange mixture of homecoming
and hunting. This city had shaped both my adoptive life and,
unknowingly, held the secrets of my biological beginnings, two separate
worlds existing in the same geographic space for decades. I was no
longer just a former resident returning; I was a detective seeking clues
to my own existence.

By Wednesday, June 4, my search led me to the magnificent main branch of
the Detroit Public Library on Woodward Avenue. As I approached the
imposing Italian Renaissance structure, its white Vermont marble façade
gleaming in the morning light, I felt both intimidated and hopeful. This
architectural masterpiece housed secrets of my past within its walls.

Inside, I was directed to the Burton Historical Collection, its
classical details and hushed reverence setting the stage for
genealogical research. The ornate murals depicting Detroit's history
seemed to watch over me as I explained my mission to the librarian, an
older gentleman whose silver-rimmed glasses reflected genuine interest.
"Forward searching is harder than backward," he noted with a knowing
smile. "But you've come to the right place."

With the librarian's help, I methodically began searching for birth
notices. Though the process was meticulous, each turn of a page
tightened my chest with anticipation, these were more than old records;
they were stepping-stones toward my own truth.

After hours of methodical work, I compiled female births from April 13,
1941, my birth mother's birth date. Only two surnames had nine letters,
matching what I'd deduced. When I later found a matching name in the
March 17, 1944 issue for my birth mother's sister's birth date, I felt
the first electric thrill of discovery. The surname was Rosenberg, and
both announcements shared the same address: 3314 Cortland in Detroit.

Each step of the way, adrenalin pumped harder throughout my body. My
heart raced as I wondered if she would even want to know me after all
these years, or if I was chasing a ghost who had long ago sealed away
that chapter of her life. Yet the momentum carried me forward.

Using the Detroit City Directory, I connected the dots to identify my
maternal grandparents. I called Jimmy Latham, my best friend from high
school who was also adopted from Crittenton. His excited voice crackled
through my phone, "Man, that's incredible! You're actually finding
them!" His enthusiasm bolstered mine, he understood the significance in
a way others couldn't.

A librarian suggested checking Mumford High School yearbooks, the school
nearest my grandparents' Wisconsin Street address. As I turned the
brittle pages of the 1958 edition, I was struck by how the school was
virtually entirely white and predominantly Jewish, a stark contrast to
the nearly all-Black Mumford of today.

The racial transformation of Mumford High, almost entirely white in
Marcia's day but predominantly Black during mine, struck me deeply. I
wondered how this shifting landscape had influenced her decisions and,
ultimately, my fate. Had the tumultuous racial changes of 1960s Detroit
shaped her choice to place me for adoption? These weren't just
historical facts but the very context of my existence.

Among the June graduates, I found her: Marcia Rosenberg. I studied the
photograph carefully, then froze. I was looking at my own face.

My peripheral vision vanished as I locked onto the image. My jaw
dropped. "That's ME!" I wanted to scream in the hushed library.

My hands trembled as I stared into eyes that mirrored my own. After
thirty-three years, I was finally seeing someone who shared my blood, my
features, my genetic heritage. The sensation transcended surreal, like
discovering a photograph of myself in a stranger's album, wearing
clothes I'd never owned. What had begun as a methodical exercise in
genealogy transformed in an instant into something viscerally personal.
This wasn't just a woman in a yearbook, this was someone whose features
I had carried with me every day of my life.

After finding Marcia's sister Sheryl in the '61 yearbook, I called Gina.
"I found her," I said simply when she answered. There was a pause, then
her voice, gentle and cautious: "How do you feel?" It was a loaded
question, I hadn't fully processed my emotions yet. "Like I've opened a
door I can't close," I replied. Gina, ever practical even while being
supportive, helped me search online and discovered Irving and Ida
Rosenberg living in West Bloomfield, just 30 miles away.

The next day dawned with renewed purpose. Before returning to the
research, I visited my alma mater, U. of D. High School, where I had a
touching reunion with Mrs. Mary Voss, the secretary whose maternal
warmth had been a constant during my teenage years.

"Derrick Burns!" she exclaimed, using my adoptive name with that
familiar blend of affection and authority.

"Look at you, all grown up and successful!"

Our conversation felt like a bridge between my established identity and
the one I was now discovering.

Afterward, I drove by my birthmother's former house on Wisconsin Street,
just four streets west of my high school. Standing outside her former
house, the physical proximity felt both comforting and cruel, each
familiar corner now imbued with newfound meaning. Wisconsin Street! Not
some vague "Detroit" that actually meant the suburbs, this was the real
Detroit, mere blocks from U of D where I'd spent my teenage years! The
streets I'd walked daily, the neighborhood I knew intimately.

This geographic coincidence left me both cheated and oddly comforted.
All those years searching for connection, and she had been literally
around the corner. How many times had our paths nearly crossed? Had we
passed each other on Livernois Avenue or at the corner store? I wondered
how our lives might intersect once we finally met. Would we experience
that same strange familiarity, like discovering a place you've somehow
always known, even in your first visit?

At Mumford High School, I noticed something I'd missed in the yearbook,
Marcia's middle initial: R. At the City-County building, I searched
marriage records and found that Marcia Rene Rosenberg had married Robert
Zelman Feldstein on August 27, 1961. They were later divorced, with the
divorce finalized on October 1, 1963, just months before my birth in
April 1964.

I also discovered that Marcia had married again, to Robert Joel Brown,
on June 29, 1969. Both of Marcia's husbands were attorneys who had
graduated from prestigious universities, adding another dimension to my
understanding of my birth mother's life.

The Final Connection

On May 9, 1997, Deborah Johnson was appointed as my "confidential search
intermediary" by the Wayne County Probate Court. While I was still in
Detroit on that June,searching through records, Deb called to tell me
she had located my birth mother and had her phone number. She planned to
call her on Monday, but I explained that I was leaving Detroit for New
York on Saturday morning and would really like to see my birth mother on
this trip if possible.

Deb agreed to contact her partner for permission to make the call
sooner. She asked me to fax her the letter I had written to my birth
mother so she could read it over the phone to her.

On June 5, 1997, I composed the most significant letter of my life,
carefully balancing honesty with sensitivity, yearning with respect for
boundaries.

Dear Mother, I imagine that you are in a state of shock right now
wondering is this really true, is this my son, and if so, why is he
contacting me after all these years?

My search for you actually started seven years ago, when my wife became
pregnant with our first child. My concerns arose from my heart not my
head. After 26 years of looking at other people and seeing no one that
looked like me, I faced the prospect of having my own child and seeing
for the first time someone that looked like me.

Seven years later I continue my search. I know that you are near. I feel
your presence and I yearn to reach out to see you.

I now have two wonderful children, a girl, age 6, and a boy, age 4. My
wife and I are happily married and share a beautiful home in Northern
California. We are both graduates of Ivy League schools. She is a
physician and I am an engineering director at a Silicon Valley computer
firm. My (adoptive) parents provided me with wonderful opportunities in
life and I am eternally grateful.

You have a separate life now, one that does not include me. I do not
wish to intrude on your life. I bear no ill will nor do I feel pain. I
wish only to meet the woman that gave me life, and, if you are willing
to get to know you. Please find it in your heart to see me.

Sincerely, Your son "Michael."

I signed with the name she would remember, the name that existed only in
that hospital room thirty-three years earlier, never used again until
this moment of reconnection. My hands shook as I sealed the envelope,
unsure if these words would bridge decades of silence or disappear into
it.

When Deb called Marcia that evening, she refused to confirm her identity
or acknowledge having a child on April 6, 1964. She expressed outrage at
being called so late at night but did take Deb's phone number.

Still dejected but determined, I explored other avenues, but each led
nowhere, deepening my frustration.

The Letter That Bridged Decades

Then, on June 13, 1997, everything changed. I was packing for my New
York trip, folding dress shirts into my suitcase, when the phone rang.
It was Deb Johnson. Her voice had a different quality this time, a
mixture of excitement and caution.

"Derrick, she wants to talk to you."

"Your birth mother wants immediate phone contact."

My hands froze mid-fold. The shirt dropped to the bed, forgotten.

"She wrote you a letter today," Deb continued.

"I'm going to fax it over right now."

I stood by the fax machine, watching as the paper emerged inch by inch,
as if the machine itself understood the weight of the moment and was
deliberately slow-walking this revelation. The mechanical whir seemed
deafening in the quiet house. What words could possibly bridge
thirty-three years of silence? What could explain the decisions made
before I had memory, choices that had shaped the entire trajectory of my
life?

The letterhead emerged first, simple, professional, followed by neat,
controlled handwriting. A mother's handwriting. My mother's handwriting.

I carried the warm pages to my desk, aware of their physical presence in
a way I rarely noticed with documents. These weren't just words; they
were artifacts from a parallel life, the life I might have lived, the
mother I might have known.

As I unfolded the faxed pages, I controlled my breathing deliberately.
This was not another research document to be quickly analyzed for
relevant data points. This was a moment to be experienced fully, a rare
intersection of lives long separated.

I began reading:

Dearest Derrick,

I have waited thirty-three years to write this letter. My search for
you, like yours, began in my heart, it began April 6, 1964. Initially,
Debbie's call left me in shock, marked by fear of being denied once
again.

Listening carefully as Debbie read your letter twice, I finally decided
to trust in the resilience of our lost hearts. I am a risk-taker, and
clearly, so are you.

An image of a glass wall with a beautiful baby boy runs through my life.
Your words have touched me as no others ever have, connecting past and
present, the child, the name, the mother.

My prayers have always been that your adoptive parents would surround
you with safety, security, and abundant love.

And you're married with children! In a single day, we have potentially
expanded our families and opened our hearts further.

I wish you love, I wish you life.

And the happiest of Father's Days to you.

My first reading was clinical, detached, a defense mechanism. The
language felt careful, even performative, as though written by someone
cautious about revealing too much. I set the letter down, unsettled.

I walked to the window, watching a neighbor drag their garbage can to
the curb, such an ordinary moment in contrast to the extraordinary one
unfolding in my office.

Returning moments later, something shifted. Beyond careful phrasing, I
sensed a familiar emotional cadence, the guarded way she balanced
vulnerability with self-protection. It was the same rhythmic dance I
performed in my own emotional life, the same tendency to intellectualize
feelings rather than simply feel them.

The realization struck me with unexpected force: this guarded approach
to emotional expression wasn't just similar to mine, it was mine. Or
rather, I had inherited it from her, carried it in my blood without ever
knowing its source. This careful, measured reaching out was as much a
genetic inheritance as my eyes or the shape of my hands.

"An image of a glass wall with a beautiful baby boy runs through my
life," she had written. I understood suddenly that she had been
searching too, in her way, carrying the weight of our separation just as
I had, peering through her own metaphorical glass barriers.

I sank back in my chair, the letter trembling slightly in my hands. The
room seemed too quiet, too still for such a momentous revelation. This
wasn't just my birth mother; this was someone whose emotional DNA I
carried, whose particular way of moving through the world mirrored my
own.

The skepticism I had initially felt toward her careful phrasing
dissolved as I recognized it as the same careful performance I had
engaged in throughout my life, the striving to be perfect, to say the
right thing, to present the ideal version of myself to the world. We
both created facades, protective barriers against potential rejection.
We were strangers connected by blood and, it seemed, by temperament, two
cautious people reaching tentatively across decades of absence.

I had spent my entire life wondering where my particular traits came
from, why I approached emotional situations with such careful analysis,
why I processed feelings through the filter of intellect before allowing
myself to experience them directly. Here, in this letter's measured
tones and carefully selected phrasings, I recognized the source.

I reached for the phone, not yet sure what I would say to this woman who
had carried me for nine months only to place me into another life
entirely. But I knew with sudden clarity that whatever happened next, I
would be speaking to someone who understood a fundamental truth about me
that even my beloved adoptive family could never fully grasp, the
particular way my mind and heart worked in tandem, the specific rhythm
of my emotional cadence.

The connection I had sought for seven years wasn't just about physical
resemblance or medical history. It was about finding the sources of my
deepest patterns, the origins of how I moved through the world. In this
carefully composed letter with its measured vulnerability, I had found
exactly that, a mirror reflecting not just my features, but my emotional
architecture.

I dialed the number Deb had provided, listening to each ring with a
strange combination of terror and anticipation. After thirty-three years
of separation, what would be the first words between a mother and the
son she had given away?

Acceptance From Beyond

In the years that followed, I developed relationships with both sides of
my birth family. While my journey to find my birth father had led me to
the discovery that he had died in 1971, I found connection through his
sister Phyllis and her daughter Karen.

After addressing Phyllis' criticism and finding my birth mother, Phyllis
and Marcia visited my parents' home to meet my village: Aunt Mildred,
Uncle Bubba, Mom's sister Vivian, Mary Debardelaben and her three girls,
Jala and her son Joshua.

Then, in 2006, nine years after our first contact, Karen called to tell
me her mother, my Aunt Phyllis, had passed away. "She left you something
in her will," Karen said, her voice gentle with the news.

The revelation struck me deeply. Phyllis, who had initially feared I had
financial motives for finding my birth father, had left me a bequest. I
didn't need or want money, had never wanted it, but this posthumous
gesture spoke volumes.

This transformation had happened largely beyond my view, revealed only
through Karen's occasional comments. "She asked about you, you know,"
Karen had mentioned the previous Christmas. "Wanted to know how your
kids were doing in school."

The bequest, modest financially but immeasurable in meaning, testified
to a private journey Phyllis had undertaken since our difficult early
calls. She had traveled from rejection to acceptance, from suspicion to
acknowledgment. More than money, she had quietly written me into the
family narrative she had guarded so carefully for decades.

As I formed the words in my mind to decline the gift, Karen reassured me
that the amount was insignificant and wouldn't impact her life. She
simply explained that it was her mother's wish for me to have something
from the family and encouraged me to accept it.

Despite my initial awkwardness, I realized this was a clear sign of
acceptance from both Karen and Phyllis. It symbolized that I did belong.
Grateful for this gesture of inclusion, I accepted the gift, feeling
that another piece of my identity had fallen into place.

Coming Full Circle

As I hung up the phone after talking with Karen, I sat quietly in my
home office, surrounded by family photos, Maya and Jamil's school
portraits, wedding pictures, snapshots from family vacations. Among them
now stood a small framed photo Phyllis had given me, my father Burton as
a young boy sitting on the lap of Joe Louis, the 'Brown Bomber', his
expression seeking, open, and inquisitive.

The journey to find my birth father had taken me from microfilm readers
to court documents, from disappointment to discovery, from isolation to
connection. What began as a search for medical information had evolved
into something far more profound, a quest to understand the complex
tapestry of heritage and circumstance that had shaped my existence.

What I found was both less and more than I had imagined, not a living
man but a legacy, not answers to all my questions but a family
connection I hadn't known I was missing.

As Maya called me for dinner, I placed Burton's photo back on the shelf,
beside the snapshots of Maya and Jamil, as if he'd always belonged
there. I joined my family, the one I had created, the one that mattered
most in my daily life. The past had given me new understanding, but my
future continued to unfold in the present moments with the people who
knew me not by blood or birth, but by choice and love.

Uncovering Marcia, my birth father's legacy, and Aunt Phyllis's
acceptance connected me deeply to a past I'd sought for decades. It
wasn't simple or singular, but it was mine, complete, complex, and
finally known.
