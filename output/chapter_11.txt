Chapter 11: Finding My Voice

"You should join the debate team."

Dad's suggestion came during one of our quiet drives home from Lawrence
Tech. The words hung in the car like smoke, carrying more weight than
their simple syllables suggested. I'd watched him for years, choosing
careful silence when Mom's sharp words filled our house. His suggestion
felt like both a gift and a confession - perhaps seeing in me the voice
he wished he'd claimed for himself.

But debate wasn't my path. Instead, I found my voice in an unexpected
place: the Model United Nations Club and Team, which had won two
consecutive national championships. I wanted to be on a national stage.
Bring it!

Competition and Growth

My passion for computing had grown beyond just playing games in the
school's computer room. When Dad told me about programming competitions
at the Lawrence Institute of Technology Mathematics Club, I was eager to
test my skills against other students.

The competitions were held monthly on Saturdays in a big conical
auditorium. We had to write programs to play battleship - not against
humans, but programs that could think like humans. Just as he drove me
to countless other activities, Dad would drive me to the data entry room
with keypunch machines.

He supplied me with stacks of blank cream-colored cards and coding paper
that he got from work. I wonder who he petitioned for these things. One
mistake meant starting over - no quick backspace key, no easy fixes.

Dad waited patiently during these competitions, probably reading his
newspaper or dozing in the car. He never complained about the long
hours, never asked why this mattered so much.

"How'd it go?" "Did you win?"

And he would listen patiently as I relayed the scoring of each round.

"Ready to head home?"

"Yes. Thanks Dad," I hope that I said each time!

I never did beat the same two Asian-American students who always seemed
to win. But in that cold computer room, punching cards and chasing
victories, I was learning lessons that went beyond programming syntax:
about persistence, about the difference between winning and succeeding,
and about building confidence through technical mastery.

These competitions taught me systematic thinking and confidence under
pressure - skills that would serve me well when I discovered my next
challenge.

Finding My Voice

David and Eric, two juniors whose quiet demeanors masked deep intellects
and fierce competitive spirit, were looking for a third person to round
out their Model UN team. A senior would be acceptable. They offered me a
chance to join them in an upcoming regional competition, just a few
hours drive from Detroit. Of course, Dad drove me.

Our school entered several teams into the event. Like our name suggests,
we modeled the operations of the UN, each team a "delegation" to a
conference where each side creates rhetoric to sway the judges in their
favor on an issue.

With our lack of seniority, we got Yemen. But during lunch breaks in the
Commons, while other delegations coasted on their countries'
reputations, we dove deep into Yemen's politics and positions: Yemen's
strategic position on the Arabian Peninsula, the impact of Saudi
influence, and our stance on Palestinian rights.

We worked through lunch periods, huddled over reference materials from
the library, building our case point by point. The other delegates might
have had the prestigious countries, but we would know our role better
than anyone knew theirs. The systematic approach I'd learned from
programming - breaking down complex problems into logical steps - served
me well in preparing our arguments.

The competition itself was held out of town. The room buzzed with
energy - dozens of teams in their best suits, playing at international
diplomacy. We stood out immediately - the only black delegation in the
room. But when I approached the podium for my first speech, something
shifted. Like the predictable logic of computer code, our careful
preparation gave me control. Each word was planned, each argument
structured. In this moment, I didn't have to navigate uncertain social
waters - I just had to execute our strategy, and my years of practice
speaking in front of people made the lectern feel like my throne.

"Distinguished delegates, the Republic of Yemen rises to address the
critical issue of regional stability..."

When they announced the awards, I barely registered my name at first. I
had won a Major Speaker Award and our delegation had won a Delegation
Award! Our small delegation from Yemen had done more than participate -
we had excelled. I read the certificate again and again, stopping at my
name like I had stopped while reading The Sign. This wasn't just about
public speaking anymore. We had transformed ourselves from outsiders
into leaders, making our voices resonate in rooms that weren't designed
for us.

Later that evening, Dad picked me up from the competition. I placed the
certificate carefully on my lap.

"How'd it go?" he asked, his usual question.

"We won the Best Minor Delegation Award as a team and I won a Major
Speaker award," I said proudly, but somewhat irritated that we did not
have a chance to compete for the Best Major Delegation Award.

He nodded, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. We drove
home in our comfortable silence, but something had changed. I had found
my voice - not in the way he'd suggested, but in a way that felt
authentically mine. In that moment, I realized I had become what he'd
hoped for - someone who could stand up and speak truth to power, who
could command attention in any room.

Growing Independence

Junior year brought my first real taste of independence. I did not
expect it to be fried! Mom's teacher salary and Dad's TACOM pay kept us
solidly middle class, but there wasn't much extra for spending money.
After weeks of pounding the pavement, I landed a job cooking at Kentucky
Fried Chicken on Van Dyke and Seven Mile.

My romantic notions of earning my own money quickly vanished when I
faced the reality of fast food work. To prevent pockets of chicken blood
from bursting into unsuspecting customers' mouths, I had to pop frozen
thigh bones out of their sockets. The process of breading the chicken,
dunking it in seasoned flour and an egg-based batter, left me coated in
a fine layer of flour dust and chicken blood.

My co-workers were mostly teenagers like me. Debbie, one of the
cashiers, was almost 21. During breaks, the smokers would gather
outside, regardless of the temperature. These weren't the "bad kids" Mom
had warned me about - they were just regular teenagers, testing limits
in their own ways.

At first, Debbie and I got along great. She'd laugh at my jokes, share
stories about her weekend parties, treat me like I belonged in her
world, until the day her view of me changed:

"You are not black!" The horror in her voice was almost comical.

"Yes, in fact, I am," I replied, letting my smile carry all the irony of
the moment.

Her face crumpled as she realized I'd heard every racist rant she'd
shared, every casual slur she'd thrown around, thinking I was "safe."

The next few shifts were deliciously awkward. A year ago, I might have
retreated into silence, found safety in invisibility. But now, like at
the Model UN podium, I owned my presence. I let her confront her
assumptions while I continued being exactly who I was - her discomfort
was no longer my problem to solve.

At fifteen and a half, I got my driving permit from Pershing High. The
freedom of movement this promised felt intoxicating. On nights when I
couldn't borrow a car, I'd bike to work, even in the depths of Detroit
winter. But even that discomfort felt like independence.

I started putting gas in my parents' cars whenever I borrowed them. The
first time I did this, Mom's surprise was worth every penny:

"Derrick, did you put gas in the car?"

"Yes, Mom."

"Well... thank you."

It was a small gesture, but it shifted something in our relationship. I
wasn't just their child anymore - I was becoming someone who could
contribute, who could think beyond my own needs.

When I got Glenn and Jimmy hired at KFC too, it felt like we were all
growing up together. Neither stayed as long as my year-and-a-half stint,
but for a while, we shared more than just school and neighborhood - we
shared the pride and exhaustion of earning our own money.

Personal Loss and Growth

The call came during dinner. Mom's fork clattered against her plate as
she listened, her face draining of color. Cancer. The word hung in our
kitchen like a physical presence. Two months, they said. Just two
months.

I was deep in my teenage self-absorption - work schedules, school
assignments, girls, college applications - when Aunt Mae's diagnosis
shattered our world. The woman who had taught me about unconditional
love through ice cream and hymns was slipping away, and Mom wouldn't let
me see her.

"No, Derrick. I don't want you to remember her like this."

But I already had memories I couldn't shake. The last time I'd visited
her house, before we knew she was sick, she'd seemed smaller somehow.
Her movements were slower, her legendary hugs a bit weaker. But her
"Shug!" still carried all the warmth it always had.

The day she died, Mom didn't come out of her room. Through the door, I
could hear her crying - not the sharp, angry sobs that sometimes came
after fighting with me, but a deep, wounded sound I'd never heard
before. Dad moved through the house like a ghost, bringing her tea she
wouldn't drink, speaking in whispers when he had to speak at all.

After the funeral, our house felt like it was underwater - everything
moved slower, sounds were muffled, colors seemed dimmer. Mom went
through the motions of daily life like an actress who'd forgotten why
she'd taken the role. Her voice, usually sharp with purpose, became flat
and distant. Even her corrections of my behavior seemed hollow.

But even in her grief, even through the fog of depression that would
take nearly a decade to lift, Mom never lost sight of her mission for
me. If anything, her determination to see me succeed grew stronger, as
if my achievement could somehow fill the void Aunt Mae's death had left.
College wasn't just an option - it was an imperative.

The unspoken part hung in the air: You're going to live the life Aunt
Mae wanted for all of us.

The College Journey

While Mom retreated into her grief after Aunt Mae's death, I was
learning to step forward. Each competition, each speech, each small
victory pulled me further from my own safe harbors of solitude. Maybe
that's why she pushed so hard for college - she saw me finding the
strength she'd temporarily lost.

College wasn't just the next step - it was a lifeline, a way to move
forward when everything around me felt frozen in loss. But in my
neighborhood, college was the exception, not the rule. The stark reality
played out in the lives of boys who lived within a block of my home.

Terrence who lived next door? Down the street? had mugged me at 13,
grabbing me as I walked from Uncle Bubba's house and demanding my wallet
with a mere $2 inside. John Eric tell us something about him…had found
his fortune in dealing drugs, his new car a bright advertisement for
choices I couldn't afford to make. These weren't cautionary tales from
the evening news - these were my neighbors, boys who'd played on the
same streets I did.

I approached the college application process with the same systematic
determination that had fueled my success in programming competitions and
Model UN. My parents didn't need to push me; the idea of staying in
Detroit never crossed my mind. My credentials were strong, awards in
public speaking, technical competition experience, involvement in
extracurricular activities, solid SAT scores, and glowing
recommendations. The programming competitions and Model UN victories had
given me confidence that I could compete at any level.

Father Polakiwski, his precise diction hinting at his own elite
education, urged us toward the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Mr.
Gulock and Doctor Morton pointed me toward MIT's engineering program.
Then came the conversation that would change everything - a casual
exchange with our future valedictorian about Princeton University. "It's
the best school in the country," he said simply, and something in me
rose to that challenge.

Getting into college was one thing, and I felt pretty confident. But
financing college was quite another concern. Mom had been setting aside
$25, $50, and $100 US Savings bonds from her paycheck since I was four.
The small fortune she had accumulated was impressive, but hardly enough
to fund even the first year of tuition at these private schools. I
needed to do my part!

So night after night, I sat at Dad's old typewriter, the same one he'd
used for Mom's master's thesis. Its green keys and case were familiar
friends by now. I applied to every scholarship that I discovered in the
large reference books that I studied at the main branch of the Detroit
Public Library and those in the College Guidance office at U of D. Each
application had to be perfect - no errors, no corrections.

The college acceptances came in waves: MIT and Michigan in December
1980, Princeton in April 1981. After the first wave, I sent off fresh
scholarship inquiries, emboldened by my success:

To whom it may concern: I, Derrick R. Burns, am a minority student in my
senior year at University of Detroit High School. In the fall of 1981, I
will be entering a program of study encompassing electrical engineering
and computer science at either the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the University of Michigan, or Princeton University; I have
been accepted into the former two schools…

Then the moment that changed everything arrived in a Western Union
Mailgram:

Bell Telephone Laboratories 600 Mountain Avenue Murray Hill, NJ 07974
Congratulations, You have been selected as a finalist for the Bell
Laboratories Engineering Scholarship Program. Please call me collect at
(201) 582-4587 on April 10, 1981 so that we may discuss your application
and scholarship. Louis Cain, Jr. Bell Tel Labs Murray Hill, NJ 13:57 EST

Four days later, another telegram arrived:

Congratulations, You have been selected as an award recipient for the
Bell Laboratories Engineering Scholarship Program. Please call me
collect at (201) 582-4587 by April 15, 1981 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM so that I
may learn if you will accept the scholarship.

Standing on our front porch, clutching that piece of paper, I yelled for
Mom. When she read it, her face transformed - the first real smile I'd
seen since Aunt Mae's death. She danced in circles, her joy breaking
through months of grief. This wasn't just a scholarship; it was
everything: full tuition, room and board, a monthly stipend, and
guaranteed summer employment at Bell Labs - with no post-graduation
obligation.

Making Choices

Dad drove me to the April hosting events at MIT and Princeton, the same
quiet presence he'd been during all those programming competitions and
Model UN events. The MIT visit shook my confidence. In a narrow dorm
room thick with marijuana smoke, my friend Mark, a High graduate and MIT
freshman, shared his latest triumph - scoring in the mid-20s on a
physics exam.

"But that's failing," I said, confused.

"No, man, you don't get it," Mark grinned through the haze. "It was
above the mean!"

The idea of celebrating what I'd always considered failure made me
deeply uncomfortable. Was this what MIT would be like?

Princeton felt different. Leslie, who'd graduated two years earlier from
Mercy, our sister school, painted a picture of possibility. Her
enthusiasm was infectious, her success tangible. But even as I leaned
toward Princeton, reality delivered one final lesson about the world I
was leaving.

Standing in the lunch line at The High, I overheard two classmates
talking. These weren't just any classmates - they were white kids whose
parents had made the supposedly progressive choice to send them from the
suburbs into Detroit for an education alongside black students.

"I heard you got into Princeton," one blurted, his voice carrying a
challenge that stripped away years of polite coexistence.

The other, our valedictorian, stood silently beside him, his silence its
own form of complicity.

"You don't deserve it. You're going to fail," the first one charged.

I walked away, their words following me like shadows. But my steps were
firm. A year ago, those words might have shaken me, might have sent me
retreating to intellectual defenses or questioning my worth. Now they
felt like echoes from a world I was already leaving behind. I knew where
I was going, and I knew I belonged there.

Years later, when I learned that Eric had become a powerhouse corporate
attorney at an elite firm after Yale, it made perfect sense. Those Model
UN competitions had taught us more than just public speaking. We'd
learned to navigate spaces where we were the only ones who looked like
us, to turn being underestimated into an advantage, to make our voices
heard even when others would prefer we stayed quiet.

I'd spent years learning to find my voice through different forms of
mastery - technical skills that taught me systematic thinking, public
speaking that gave me confidence, work experience that showed me
independence. All of it had led to this moment: standing on the
threshold between the world I knew and the world I was about to enter.

I was ready for whatever came next.
