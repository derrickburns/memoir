## CHAPTER 1: Two Worlds Converging

**Time Period:** April 1964
**Narrator's Age:** Birth
**Key Characters:**
- Birth mother (22 years old, Jewish woman, nearly finished with college degree, divorced)
- Burton (birth father, Black law student at Harvard)
- Willa Burns (adoptive mother, teacher, struggled with infertility)
- Howard Burns (adoptive father, had son he couldn't reach)
- Derrick Raynard Burns (narrator, baby, mixed race)

**Summary:**

The memoir opens with the convergence of two separate lives at Crittenton Hospital in Detroit in April 1964. Derrick's birth mother, a 22-year-old Jewish woman pregnant by a Black law student, lived for months in a maternity home that shielded young women from societal judgment. In 1964 Detroit, racial and religious boundaries weren't merely social—they were fiercely maintained lines between worlds. Her parents had arranged her stay to shield their eldest daughter from scrutiny.

Meanwhile, adoptive mother Willa Burns graded papers at her dining room table, trying to ignore the empty nursery down the hall, each month bringing the same disappointment and quiet grief. Her husband Howard watched helplessly, carrying his own private pain from a son he couldn't reach. When the adoption supervisor called about a mixed-race baby boy, Willa's deepest fear surfaced: "What if people don't believe I'm his mother?" Howard responded with quiet resolve: "Willa, you don't select a child like a pair of shoes."

The birth mother held baby Michael (later renamed Derrick) once, memorizing his face before leaving the hospital alone with an ache she would carry for thirty-three years. For five weeks, Derrick lived between worlds in temporary care. When Willa and Howard finally brought him home, a colleague hung a sign: "Congratulations to Derrick Raynard for getting such wonderful, loving parents!" Young Derrick would later stare at those letters, puzzled: "Mom, what did I do to get congratulated?" The space between "chosen" and "belonging" would become the defining geography of his childhood.

**Key Events:**
- Birth mother's months at Crittenton Hospital maternity home
- April 1964: Derrick's birth at Crittenton Hospital
- Birth mother holds baby once, names him Michael, then leaves alone
- Five weeks in temporary care while papers processed
- Willa and Howard bring baby home, rename him Derrick Raynard Burns
- "Congratulations" sign hung in basement

**Themes:**
- Adoption and belonging
- Racial and religious boundaries in 1964 Detroit
- The space between "chosen" and "belonging"
- Identity formation from birth
- Love and uncertainty coexisting

## CHAPTER 2: The Perfect Shot

**Time Period:** 1960s-early 1970s (childhood through age ~7)
**Narrator's Age:** Early childhood
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, young child)
- Willa Burns (Mom, teacher, active in sororities and church)
- Howard Burns (Dad, federal employee at TACOM, photographer)
- Dave (adopted brother, arrives when Derrick is ~4-5)

**Summary:**

This chapter explores Derrick's early childhood memories, centered around his father's photography and the family's careful documentation of their life together. Howard Burns was a meticulous photographer who approached every shot with precision—the perfect lighting, perfect angle, perfect moment captured. These photographs would become the family's official narrative, showing happy adopted sons in a loving Black family.

Derrick describes his mother Willa as a force of nature—a teacher who was deeply involved in church and sorority activities, particularly Zeta Phi Beta. She maintained high standards for her children and household. Howard worked at TACOM (Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command) in Warren, maintaining the same precision in his federal job managing payroll that he brought to his photography.

The chapter weaves between memories of posed family photos and the reality of daily life. There are hints of the performative nature of belonging—Derrick learning early to present the "right" image, to be the son his parents could be proud to show the world. The arrival of brother Dave is mentioned, adding complexity to family dynamics.

**Key Events:**
- Early childhood memories of being photographed
- Dad's meticulous approach to photography
- Mom's involvement in Zeta Phi Beta sorority and church
- Dad's work at TACOM federal facility
- Family creating visual narrative through photographs
- Brother Dave's presence in the family

**Themes:**
- Performance vs. authenticity
- Family documentation and narrative creation
- Precision and perfectionism
- Building a family through adoption
- The "perfect shot" as metaphor for presenting the ideal family

## CHAPTER 3: Lessons from Aunt Mae

**Time Period:** 1960s-1970s (childhood, ages ~5-10)
**Narrator's Age:** Elementary school years
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, young boy)
- Classie Mae Walker, "Aunt Mae" (Willa's sister and surrogate mother, tall, buxom, welcoming, childless)
- Uncle John Walker (Aunt Mae's husband, played checkers, sat on porch)
- Snuffy (Aunt Mae's golden collie dog)
- Willa Burns (Mom, more reserved and demanding than her sister)
- Howard Burns (Dad)

**Summary:**

Weekend visits to Aunt Mae's house at 18606 Mackay provided Derrick with his first experiences of unconditional belonging. Aunt Mae—who had been a surrogate mother to Willa and her sister but had no children of her own—treated Derrick like a beloved grandchild, calling him "Shug" (short for "sugar"). Unlike the careful performance required at home with rules and Primary Church and Mom's high expectations, Aunt Mae's house was a refuge of simple acceptance.

The visits followed warm rituals: arriving to Aunt Mae's greeting at the screen door (smelling like vanilla and fabric softener), helping her make the bed in the small back bedroom, sitting in the curve of her arm while she read her Bible, making homemade ice cream together while Uncle John played checkers on the porch. There was bacon in the morning, playing with Snuffy the golden collie in the backyard (navigating the "obstacle course" of dog poop), and Sunday services at Corinthian Baptist Church where Aunt Mae sang in the choir.

Aunt Mae embodied a different kind of motherhood than Willa—less focused on achievement and "The Project," more focused on simply being present and accepting. She asked "What do you want to do today, Shug?"—a question that surprised young Derrick because at home, Saturdays meant chores and errands that moved around his wants, never with them. She invited him to help with small tasks, wanted him close, created entire afternoons to make something together. When he broke eggshells into the bowl, she fished them out gently. When the ice cream crank grew heavy, "her hands covered mine when I needed help."

These visits became touchstones showing what ease and belonging could feel like. The contrast with his own home—where love was certain but tied to achievement and proper behavior—taught him early about conditional versus unconditional acceptance. Aunt Mae's lessons weren't spoken; they were lived in how she welcomed him, how she looked at him "like I was exactly who she'd been hoping to see, every single time." But the visits also created painful questions: Was he betraying Mom for preferring it at Aunt Mae's? Was he ungrateful for wanting "this place where mistakes didn't matter"?

**Key Events:**
- Regular weekend visits to Aunt Mae's house (18606 Mackay)
- Friday night rituals: making the bed together, washing up on the wooden stool, sitting while Aunt Mae read her Bible
- Saturday activities: playing with Snuffy, making homemade ice cream together, watching Uncle John play checkers
- Sunday church at Corinthian Baptist where Aunt Mae sang in choir
- The painful goodbyes and drive home in Mom's Pontiac
- Derrick's realization: "I never felt more loved and more secure than I did in that small two bedroom home"

**Themes:**
- Unconditional vs. conditional love
- Different models of motherhood/caregiving
- Belonging without performance
- Extended family as refuge
- The gift of simply being accepted and wanted
- Guilt about preferring one place over another
- Surrogate mother (Aunt Mae to Willa) becoming grandmother figure to Derrick

## CHAPTER 4: The Project Begins

**Time Period:** 1967-1968 (kindergarten and summer school)
**Narrator's Age:** 3-4 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, very young child in kindergarten)
- Willa Burns (Mom, teacher, concerned about Derrick's education)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- Kindergarten teacher (early educator)
- Summer school teachers (educators working with very young Derrick)

**Summary:**

Willa Burns, a teacher herself, recognized early that education would be Derrick's path to success. She enrolled him in kindergarten at age 3 and orchestrated summer school experiences to accelerate his learning. "The Project" began—Willa's determined effort to ensure her adopted son would have every advantage, every opportunity to excel.

This chapter shows Willa's fierce advocacy for her children's education, rooted in her understanding that as a Black child in America—especially one who was adopted and mixed-race—Derrick would need to be exceptional to be considered equal. She pushed him into academic settings early, creating structure and expectations that would shape his entire approach to achievement.

Young Derrick experienced this as both gift and burden. He was bright and capable, meeting his mother's expectations, but the underlying message was clear: achievement was how he would prove his worthiness, how he would justify his parents' choice to adopt him, how he would make them proud enough to feel the adoption was successful.

**Key Events:**
- Kindergarten enrollment at age 3
- Summer school experiences at very young age
- Mom's educational advocacy and intervention
- Beginning of "The Project"—Mom's plan for Derrick's success
- Early academic pressure and expectations

**Themes:**
- Education as pathway to belonging
- Parental ambition and advocacy
- Achievement as proof of worthiness
- Black excellence as necessity, not choice
- The burden of being "chosen" and special

## CHAPTER 5: Developing the Picture

**Time Period:** 1960s (early childhood, ages ~4-7)
**Narrator's Age:** Early elementary years
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, young boy becoming aware of race)
- Howard Burns (Dad, photographer, storyteller)
- Willa Burns (Mom)
- Family members from Dad's photographs and stories
- Dave (brother)

**Summary:**

Using photography as metaphor, this chapter explores how Derrick's understanding of his identity slowly developed like a photograph emerging in a darkroom. Dad's photography hobby becomes the vehicle for family storytelling—Howard showing Derrick old photographs, explaining family history, sharing stories about relatives.

But the photographs also revealed what was unspoken. In family albums, Derrick could see the gradations of skin tone, could recognize that he looked different from his parents, could sense the complex narratives around race and adoption that adults handled with careful silence. The "development" wasn't just of photographs but of Derrick's racial awareness and his understanding of where he fit in his family and community.

Dad's stories about family members revealed a world of Black achievement, resilience, and community. But they also highlighted difference—Derrick wasn't born into this family, he was chosen into it. Each photograph was both proof of belonging and reminder of origin elsewhere. The chapter title's double meaning captures how identity develops slowly, through layers of experience and awareness.

**Key Events:**
- Dad sharing family photographs and stories
- Derrick's growing awareness of skin tone and racial differences
- Learning family history through photography
- Developing understanding of adoption and belonging
- Racial awakening through visual comparison

**Themes:**
- Identity development as gradual process
- Photography as both documentation and narrative
- Racial awareness and difference
- Family history and storytelling
- The complexity of adopted identity

## CHAPTER 6: Dave Arrives

**Time Period:** 1968
**Narrator's Age:** 4 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, 4-year-old feeling lonely)
- Dave (adopted brother, infant/toddler, also mixed-race)
- Willa Burns (Mom, wanting to give Derrick a sibling)
- Howard Burns (Dad)

**Summary:**

At age 4, Derrick was lonely despite his parents' love and Aunt Mae's welcoming extended family. Willa and Howard decided to adopt a second child, believing a sibling would give Derrick the companionship he needed. Dave arrived—another mixed-race baby, another chosen child to join the Burns family.

Derrick's initial reaction was complex: excitement at having a brother, but also uncertainty about sharing his parents' attention and love. The adoption of Dave both validated Derrick's own story (he wasn't the only one, adoption was simply how this family was built) and complicated it (now he had to share the specialness of being chosen).

The chapter captures the early bond between the brothers—two boys who would share the unique experience of being mixed-race adopted children in a Black family in 1960s Detroit. Their connection was immediate in some ways, complicated in others. They were both chosen, both between worlds, both given the surname Burns and the task of making their parents proud.

**Key Events:**
- Derrick's loneliness at age 4
- Parents' decision to adopt a second child
- Dave's arrival in the family (another mixed-race adoption)
- Early bonding between brothers
- Adjustment to being a sibling rather than only child
- Two adopted boys becoming brothers

**Themes:**
- Sibling bonds and chosen family
- Sharing parents' love and attention
- Adoption as family-building strategy
- Loneliness and connection
- Two children "between worlds" finding each other

## CHAPTER 7: Two Different Boys

**Time Period:** 1968-1970 (early childhood)
**Narrator's Age:** 4-6 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, compliant, achievement-focused)
- Dave (brother, more rebellious, different personality)
- Willa Burns (Mom, managing two very different sons)
- Howard Burns (Dad)

**Summary:**

Despite sharing adoption stories and mixed-race identities, Derrick and Dave were fundamentally different children. Derrick was compliant, eager to please, driven by his mother's "Project" to achieve and excel. Dave was more spirited, more willing to test boundaries, more resistant to the careful performance that Derrick had already internalized.

These differences created different relationships with their parents. Derrick's compliance earned praise and reinforced his strategy of achieving his way to belonging. Dave's resistance led to more conflict but perhaps also more authenticity. Watching his brother navigate the same family with a different approach taught Derrick early lessons about choice, personality, and paths to acceptance.

Mom handled two different boys with two different approaches, trying to shape each toward success while respecting (or struggling with) their different temperaments. The chapter explores how even within the same family, with the same adoption story, two children can have vastly different experiences based on personality and choice.

**Key Events:**
- Early manifestation of personality differences between brothers
- Different approaches to parental expectations
- Derrick's compliance vs. Dave's resistance
- Mom's different interactions with each son
- Brothers learning they can choose different paths

**Themes:**
- Personality and temperament
- Different paths to belonging
- Compliance vs. authenticity
- Sibling contrast and comparison
- Nature vs. nurture in family dynamics

## CHAPTER 8: Finding My Voice

**Time Period:** 1972-1976 (middle school and England trip)
**Narrator's Age:** 8-12 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, middle school student at Law Middle School)
- Doctor Jones (significant teacher/mentor figure)
- Willa Burns (Mom, continues to advocate for Derrick's education)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- Dave (brother)
- Classmates at Law Middle School

**Summary:**

Middle school at Law Middle School brought new challenges and opportunities. Doctor Jones emerges as a significant mentor figure, helping Derrick begin to find his voice beyond just compliance and achievement. This was a time of intellectual awakening and growing confidence.

A transformative family trip to England exposed Derrick to a world beyond Detroit, showing him different cultural contexts and broadening his understanding of possibility. The trip was both educational and disorienting—seeing how race operated differently in another country, experiencing being American abroad, understanding that Detroit's racial dynamics weren't universal laws but local configurations.

The chapter title "Finding My Voice" suggests Derrick beginning to speak up, to contribute, to express himself beyond just meeting expectations. Doctor Jones and the England experience together helped him recognize that he could be more than just a good student—he could have ideas, perspectives, and contributions that mattered.

**Key Events:**
- Middle school years at Law Middle School
- Mentorship from Doctor Jones
- Family trip to England (eye-opening cultural exposure)
- Intellectual development and growing confidence
- Beginning to find voice beyond compliance
- Seeing race and identity in different cultural context

**Themes:**
- Mentorship and guidance
- Finding voice and confidence
- Cultural exposure and broadening perspective
- Identity in different contexts
- Moving from compliance to contribution

## CHAPTER 9: The Power of Belonging

**Time Period:** 1977-1979 (high school years)
**Narrator's Age:** 13-15 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, high school student at University of Detroit High School)
- Fellow students at U of D High School
- Teachers and mentors
- Willa Burns (Mom)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- Dave (brother)

**Summary:**

University of Detroit High School provided Derrick with his first real experience of belonging to a community beyond his family. The school's environment—likely more diverse and intellectually challenging than earlier schools—allowed him to find his tribe. He discovered computers during this era, finding in technology a space where logic and merit could overcome other barriers.

The power of belonging came from being part of something larger than himself, from finding peers who shared his interests and ambitions, from experiencing acceptance based on contribution rather than careful performance. This was different from Aunt Mae's unconditional acceptance—this was earned belonging through shared passion and mutual respect.

High school also brought growing sophistication in understanding race, class, and opportunity. Derrick was being prepared for college, specifically for Princeton, though that dream still seemed distant. The community at U of D High School taught him that belonging was possible, that he could find spaces where his "between worlds" identity was asset rather than burden.

**Key Events:**
- Attending University of Detroit High School
- Discovery of computers and technology
- Finding community and peer belonging
- Academic preparation for college
- Developing sense of earned belonging through contribution
- Building foundation for Princeton application

**Themes:**
- Community and peer belonging
- Technology as equalizer
- Intellectual passion and shared interests
- Merit and contribution as paths to acceptance
- Preparation for future opportunities

## CHAPTER 10: Performing Identity

**Time Period:** 1977-1986 (high school through college preparation)
**Narrator's Age:** 13-22 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, becoming sophisticated at performing identity)
- Peers in different social contexts
- Willa Burns (Mom)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- Dave (brother)
- Various teachers and mentors

**Summary:**

By high school and college preparation years, Derrick had become expert at reading contexts and performing the identity each situation required. With white teachers and administrators, he performed the exceptional Black student—articulate, non-threatening, proof that the system worked. With Black peers, he navigated complex authenticity tests—was he Black enough? Too white? With his parents, he performed the grateful adopted son, the validation of their choice.

This chapter examines the exhausting work of code-switching and identity performance. Derrick learned to modulate his speech, his interests, his presentation of self depending on audience. He became a chameleon, skilled at giving people what they wanted to see, at fitting himself into others' expectations.

The Princeton preparation intensified this performance. He had to be exceptional enough to be accepted, but not so different as to be threatening. He had to represent both his race (proving Black students could succeed at elite institutions) and transcend it (being judged as an individual). The chapter reveals how survival through performance becomes identity when practiced long enough.

**Key Events:**
- Mastering code-switching and identity performance
- Navigating different social contexts (white institutions, Black community, family)
- Princeton application and preparation process
- Becoming expert at meeting different audiences' expectations
- Internal conflict between performance and authenticity
- Recognition that performance has become identity

**Themes:**
- Identity performance and code-switching
- Authenticity vs. survival
- W.E.B. Du Bois's concept of double consciousness
- The exhaustion of constant adaptation
- Success requiring performance in multiple contexts

## CHAPTER 11: Finding My Voice

**Time Period:** 1978-1981 (high school, Model UN, college applications)
**Narrator's Age:** 14-17 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, high school student finding leadership)
- Model UN teammates and advisors
- Business ventures partners
- Willa Burns (Mom, supporting college ambitions)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- College admissions officers

**Summary:**

Model United Nations became a vehicle for Derrick to develop his voice in structured, sanctioned ways. Representing different countries in debate and diplomacy, he learned to argue, persuade, and lead. The program rewarded exactly the skills he'd been developing—research, articulation, strategic thinking, performance.

Beyond Model UN, Derrick showed early entrepreneurial tendencies, starting small business ventures that demonstrated initiative and ambition. These weren't just resume builders; they were explorations of agency and self-determination. If he could create value in the marketplace, he could prove his worth independent of anyone's judgment.

The college application process loomed large. Derrick was building a profile designed to appeal to elite institutions: academic achievement, leadership, extracurriculars, compelling narrative. He was packaging himself as the kind of student Princeton would want—the exceptional Black student from Detroit who overcame adoption and mixed-race identity to achieve excellence. The performance was becoming more sophisticated, more strategic, more successful.

**Key Events:**
- Leadership in Model United Nations
- Development of debate and persuasion skills
- Early entrepreneurial ventures and business initiatives
- Strategic college application process
- Building profile for elite university admission
- Learning to package narrative for maximum impact

**Themes:**
- Leadership development in structured contexts
- Entrepreneurship and self-determination
- Strategic narrative construction
- Voice as performance vs. authentic expression
- Packaging identity for institutional acceptance

## CHAPTER 12: Finding My Place at Princeton

**Time Period:** 1981-1986 (Princeton years)
**Narrator's Age:** 17-22 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, Princeton student)
- Jamal Mazrui (roommate, blind student from Michigan, became lifelong friend)
- Tonya Chisholm (NSBE President, mentor, Class of 1982)
- Kevin Dowdell (outgoing NSBE president)
- Steve Ballmer (Microsoft recruiter, later CEO)
- Czerny Brasuell (Third World Center director)
- James Raby (fellow NSBE member, lifelong friend)
- The Prophet (charismatic cult-like figure)
- Charles Vandross (engineering student, distant cousin of Luther Vandross)
- Sheila Dooley, Joanne, Kristie Lancaster (Trice-as-Nice DJs)
- Gary Jenkins, Charles Anderson (Sonic Sounds DJs, mentors)
- Michael Kandall (project partner, "snarky Jewish buddy from Connecticut")
- Willa Burns (Mom, advised finishing degree over Microsoft)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- Campus girlfriend (used weed and possibly cocaine)

**Summary:**

Princeton was transformative and nearly broke Derrick. Arriving late meant a bottom bunk in a cramped quad with nine roommates. Meeting blind roommate Jamal Mazrui from Michigan became a defining relationship—two young Black men from Michigan refusing to bow intellectually to anyone. Before exams, they'd pump each other up: "Bust it out! Write the answer key!"

The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) saved him. President Tonya Chisholm's message wasn't about belonging—it was about redefining it: "We don't just want to finish the race together. We want to cross the finish line first." At his first NSBE national conference in Detroit, a thousand Black engineering students rose to their feet, chanting "NEZ-BE! NEZ-BE!" Derrick realized: "We were not different here. We were not the exception. We were a community, one thousand strong."

By sophomore year, Derrick became NSBE chapter president. When he proposed increasing company sponsorship fees from $150 to $500, leadership worried companies would stop coming. Derrick countered: "Which bike is better, the $150 bike or the $500 bike?" The gamble paid off—increased fees meant sending every member to nationals. "We weren't asking for help anymore. We were creating our own economy of excellence."

Steve Ballmer interviewed Derrick as a sophomore for a full-time Microsoft position: $27,000 salary, 15% bonus, stock options. After solving Ballmer's orange-vs-banana algorithm problem, Derrick confessed: "To be honest, I am bored in school. I want to build things." The offer arrived. But Mom insisted: "Derrick, you need to finish your degree. No one can ever take a Princeton degree from you." He declined, later wondering if fear drove the decision—fear of losing his NSBE community.

Czerny Brasuell at the Third World Center taught him to see invisible white privilege—how a room with white kids was "normal" while a room with Black kids was marked as different. She co-authored a paper on Black student challenges; the administration's response disgusted her, and she left Princeton.

Junior year brought the Prophet—a charismatic white figure attracting Black followers, including Derrick's friends. Derrick convinced Jamal to attend a dinner with the Prophet and his disciples at Princeton Inn. The Prophet's vague promises met Jamal's surgical questioning: "Could you please explain your prophecies more specifically?" "What specific events have you predicted?" "So no specific predictions then? Just general feelings anyone might have?" One by one, followers saw the emperor had no clothes. But logic rarely overcomes faith.

As NSBE president locally and National Treasurer, Derrick found external validation that fueled his soul—until it didn't. Restlessness ate at him. He'd consume entire boxes of Entenmann's chocolate chip cookies before reaching his dorm. His campus relationship imploded over his condescending comments about her drug use.

**Key Events:**
- Late arrival to Princeton, bottom bunk in cramped nine-person quad
- Meeting blind roommate Jamal Mazrui, lifelong friendship begins
- NSBE conference in Detroit with 1,000 Black engineering students
- Election as NSBE chapter president (sophomore year)
- Increasing sponsorship fees from $150 to $500 (successful gamble)
- Steve Ballmer interview, Microsoft offer ($27,000 + bonus + options)
- Declining Microsoft to finish Princeton (Mom's advice)
- Third World Center and Czerny Brasuell's lessons on systemic racism
- Confronting the Prophet with Jamal at Princeton Inn
- Election as NSBE National Treasurer
- Restlessness despite external validation
- Relationship breakdown, compulsive eating, seeking belonging

**Themes:**
- Black excellence and community at elite institutions
- Finding belonging through NSBE (not Princeton itself)
- Choosing community over individual opportunity
- Seeing systemic racism and white privilege
- Performance vs. authenticity in elite spaces
- Brotherhood and intellectual courage (Jamal)
- The exhaustion of constant code-switching

## CHAPTER 13: Understanding My Path

**Time Period:** 1986-1989 (Stanford graduate school)
**Narrator's Age:** 22-25 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, graduate student in theoretical computer science)
- Stanford professors and advisors
- Fellow graduate students
- Silicon Graphics colleagues
- Willa Burns (Mom)
- Howard Burns (Dad)
- Dave (brother)

**Summary:**

After Princeton, Derrick headed to Stanford for graduate school in theoretical computer science. Stanford represented both continuation of the elite educational path and a move to Silicon Valley, where technology and innovation were reshaping the world. Graduate school demanded different skills than undergraduate—deep specialization, research, independent thinking rather than performing for grades.

At Stanford, Derrick began working at Silicon Graphics, bridging academic theory with industry practice. The experience showed him that theoretical computer science, while intellectually satisfying, wasn't where his passion truly lay. He was drawn to building things, to practical applications, to seeing technology solve real problems.

This chapter's title "Understanding My Path" suggests growing clarity about what he wanted to do versus what he thought he should do. Graduate school revealed that academic achievement, while validating, wasn't necessarily fulfilling. The path forward would require choosing passion over prestige, practical over theoretical, building over proving.

**Key Events:**
- Graduate school at Stanford in theoretical computer science
- Beginning work at Silicon Graphics
- Bridging academic theory and industry practice
- Recognition that theoretical CS isn't his true passion
- Growing clarity about wanting to build vs. research
- Understanding difference between achievement and fulfillment

**Themes:**
- Academic achievement vs. personal fulfillment
- Theory vs. practice in career choice
- Silicon Valley's pull and promise
- Path clarity through elimination
- Choosing passion over prestige

## CHAPTER 14: Encountering Love

**Time Period:** 1988-1989
**Narrator's Age:** 24-25 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, Silicon Valley professional)
- Gina Gregory (later Gina Gregory-Burns, woman Derrick meets and falls in love with)
- Friends and colleagues who introduce them or are part of their social circle

**Summary:**

Derrick met Gina Gregory, and the encounter would change his life. Meeting Gina represented encountering a different kind of relationship than he'd experienced before—one that would challenge his patterns of performance and demand authenticity he wasn't sure he could offer.

Gina brought her own intelligence, ambition, and complexity to the relationship. This wasn't just romance; it was the beginning of a partnership that would span decades, producing children, surviving crises, and ultimately helping Derrick transform from performance to presence.

The chapter captures early relationship dynamics—attraction, discovery, the revelation of finding someone who sees you and chooses to stay anyway. But it also hints at challenges to come: Derrick's ingrained patterns of performance, his difficulty with vulnerability, the ways his childhood experiences of conditional belonging would show up in adult intimate relationships.

**Key Events:**
- Meeting Gina Gregory
- Early relationship development
- Falling in love in late 1980s Silicon Valley
- Beginning of long-term partnership
- First experiences of intimate relationship demanding authenticity

**Themes:**
- Love and partnership
- Vulnerability in intimate relationships
- Performance patterns showing up in romance
- Finding partner who sees authentic self
- Beginning of transformative relationship

## CHAPTER 15: Becoming Real

**Time Period:** 1990-1995 (early fatherhood)
**Narrator's Age:** 26-31 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, new father)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, mother)
- Maya Burns (daughter, born ~1990)
- Jamil Burns (son, born ~1993)
- Willa Burns (Mom, grandmother)
- Howard Burns (Dad, grandfather)
- Dave (brother, uncle)

**Summary:**

Becoming a father transformed Derrick's understanding of identity, love, and authenticity. When daughter Maya was born around 1990, followed by son Jamil around 1993, Derrick confronted what it meant to be a father—not as performance but as presence, not as role but as relationship.

Fatherhood forced questions he'd avoided: What kind of father would he be? Could he offer unconditional love when he'd never been entirely sure he'd received it? How would his own adoption and "chosen" status affect how he parented biological children? The chapter title "Becoming Real" echoes the Velveteen Rabbit—love making you authentic, even if the process of becoming real is painful and involves being worn down.

With Maya and Jamil, Derrick couldn't hide behind achievement and performance. Infants and toddlers demanded presence, authenticity, emotional availability. They needed a father who was simply there, not one who was impressive. This terrified and transformed him. Through stumbles and successes, he began learning what his children would later teach him fully: that love isn't about being perfect, it's about being present.

**Key Events:**
- Birth of daughter Maya (~1990)
- Birth of son Jamil (~1993)
- Transition to fatherhood and family life
- Confronting what kind of father to be
- Learning to be present rather than impressive
- Beginning transformation from performance to authenticity

**Themes:**
- Fatherhood as transformative experience
- Biological children of adopted parent
- Unconditional love and presence
- Authenticity demanded by parenthood
- Breaking generational patterns
- "Becoming real" through love

- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, supporting search)
- Maya Burns (young daughter)
- Jamil Burns (young son)
- Search angels and adoption intermediaries
- Birth mother's family
- Burton's family members

**Summary:**

Having his own children intensified Derrick's need to understand his origins. What did Maya and Jamil inherit from him, and what had he inherited from parents he'd never known? The search for birth parents became urgent—not to replace Willa and Howard, but to complete the picture of who he was.

The search revealed both hoped-for connections and devastating truths. His birth mother, the Jewish woman who held him once at Crittenton Hospital, was found after years of searching. Their reunion was complex—healing for both, but also highlighting the 33-year gap, the different lives they'd lived, the impossibility of truly recovering what was lost.

Burton, his birth father, had been a brilliant Black law student at Harvard who co-authored academic papers as an undergraduate. But Burton died by suicide, taking with him answers to questions Derrick would always carry. The discovery of Burton's death, the partial recovery of his story, the recognition of traits Derrick inherited—all of it was "what blood remembers" even when conscious memory is absent.

**Key Events:**
- Decision to search for birth parents (triggered by own fatherhood)
- Years-long search process with intermediaries
- Finding birth mother, emotional reunion
- Learning about Burton's brilliance at Harvard
- Discovery that Burton died by suicide
- Partial recovery of birth father's story
- Understanding genetic inheritance and traits
- Complex emotions of reunion and loss

**Themes:**
- Adoption and search for origins
- Biological inheritance vs. chosen family
- Loss and recovery
- Suicide's lasting impact across generations
- Identity completion through origin story
- "Blood memory" and genetic inheritance

## CHAPTER 17: What Love Complicates

**Time Period:** 1997-2010
**Narrator's Age:** 33-46 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, navigating relationship with Marcia)
- Marcia (significant romantic relationship outside marriage)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife)
- Maya Burns (daughter, observing family dynamics)
- Jamil Burns (son, observing family dynamics)
- Willa Burns (Mom, declining health)
- Dave (brother)

**Summary:**

This chapter tackles the most difficult truth of Derrick's adult life: his relationship with Marcia, which complicated and nearly destroyed his marriage to Gina. The affair/relationship lasted over a decade, from 1997 to 2010, overlapping with his children's formative years, his father's death, and his mother's illness.

What began as attraction became entanglement. Derrick, who'd spent his life performing different identities for different audiences, found in Marcia someone who saw a version of him that felt real—but was it real, or was it another performance? The relationship represented both escape from the pressures of marriage and family, and betrayal of the people who loved him most authentically.

The title "What Love Complicates" acknowledges that love isn't simple or pure. It can coexist with betrayal. It can motivate both devotion and destruction. Derrick's love for Gina was real; his connection to Marcia was real; the damage to his family was real. All these truths existed simultaneously, refusing to resolve into simple narrative.

**Key Events:**
- Beginning of relationship with Marcia (1997)
- Over a decade of complicated entanglement (1997-2010)
- Impact on marriage with Gina
- Children's awareness and hurt
- Attempting to manage multiple relationships and identities
- Damage to family trust and stability
- The complexity of loving multiple people
- Relationship with Marcia continuing through family crises

**Themes:**
- Infidelity and betrayal
- Multiple authentic selves vs. fragmentation
- Love's complexity and contradictions
- Impact of parental choices on children
- Performance taken to destructive extreme
- Escape vs. presence
- Damage and consequences of living divided

## CHAPTER 18: Beyond the Algorithm

**Time Period:** 1990-1998 (Silicon Graphics years)
**Narrator's Age:** 26-34 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, engineer at Silicon Graphics)
- Silicon Graphics colleagues and managers
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife)
- Maya Burns (young daughter)
- Jamil Burns (young son)
- Engineering peers and competitors

**Summary:**

At Silicon Graphics, Derrick discovered that technical excellence—the algorithm, the elegant solution, the brilliant code—wasn't enough. Corporate success required navigating politics, building alliances, managing perceptions, self-promotion. The best technical solution didn't always win; the best-sold solution won.

This was disorienting for someone who'd believed that meritocracy was real, that achievement would speak for itself. Derrick had been taught that being twice as good meant inevitable success. But "beyond the algorithm" lay a whole domain of skills he hadn't developed: reading room dynamics, building executive relationships, strategic visibility, corporate performance.

The chapter reveals Silicon Valley's gap between engineering culture (which valued technical merit) and business culture (which valued outcomes, relationships, and perception). Derrick was excellent at the former, still learning the latter. The title suggests both the limitations of technical brilliance alone and the need to develop skills beyond pure problem-solving.

**Key Events:**
- Years at Silicon Graphics as engineer
- Recognition that technical excellence isn't sufficient for advancement
- Encountering corporate politics and relationship building
- Discovering gap between merit and success
- Learning (or failing to learn) executive presence
- Disillusionment with pure meritocracy
- Tension between technical and political skills

**Themes:**
- Limits of technical excellence
- Corporate politics and relationship building
- Meritocracy myths
- Engineering culture vs. business culture
- Strategic visibility and self-promotion
- Performance in corporate contexts
- Silicon Valley's complexity beyond innovation

## CHAPTER 19: Swimming with Sharks

**Time Period:** 1998-2006 (career transitions through multiple tech companies)
**Narrator's Age:** 34-42 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, navigating multiple company transitions)
- Various executives, colleagues, and bosses at multiple tech companies
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, providing stability during transitions)
- Maya Burns (daughter, watching father's career stress)
- Jamil Burns (son, watching father's career stress)
- Marcia (ongoing complicated relationship)

**Summary:**

After Silicon Graphics, Derrick moved through multiple tech companies during the dot-com boom and bust: startups, established firms, each promising the next big thing. The chapter title "Swimming with Sharks" captures the predatory nature of Silicon Valley during this era—ruthless competition, ethical compromises, companies rising and falling rapidly.

Each transition promised something better: more money, better title, stock options that would make him rich. But each revealed the same pattern: Derrick's technical brilliance got him hired, but navigating corporate politics and performing executive presence determined whether he'd succeed or be pushed out. He was swimming with people who'd been raised understanding these games, while he was still learning the rules.

The constant transitions took their toll on family life. Gina provided stability while Derrick churned through companies. The children watched their father's stress, his long hours, his frustration with being passed over despite being technically superior. The decade taught painful lessons about Silicon Valley meritocracy, corporate loyalty, and the cost of chasing success defined by others.

**Key Events:**
- Leaving Silicon Graphics (1998)
- Multiple company transitions over 8 years
- Dot-com boom and bust experiences
- Career frustrations and being passed over for advancement
- Impact of work stress on family
- Stock options and compensation chasing
- Learning harsh lessons about corporate loyalty
- Ongoing relationship with Marcia during career stress

**Themes:**
- Silicon Valley ruthlessness
- Corporate disloyalty and constant transitions
- Work-life balance failure
- Success chasing and disappointment
- Technical merit vs. political savvy
- Family stability amid career chaos
- Cost of career ambition on relationships

## CHAPTER 20: Searching for Black Excellence

**Time Period:** 2000-2004 (joining The Boule)
**Narrator's Age:** 36-40 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, joining Sigma Pi Phi "The Boule")
- Boule members (Black professional men)
- Sponsors and mentors in The Boule
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Howard Burns (Dad, declining health/recently deceased)
- Willa Burns (Mom)

**Summary:**

The Boule (Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity) represented the pinnacle of Black professional achievement—the oldest Black Greek-letter organization, founded in 1904, comprising doctors, lawyers, judges, executives, and entrepreneurs. Joining required sponsorship, vetting, demonstrated achievement. For Derrick, it promised community among Black men who'd "made it."

But The Boule also revealed class tensions within Black America. These were men of achievement and status, but was this the Black excellence Derrick was searching for? Was belonging among the Black elite different from the NSBE community that saved him at Princeton? The organization provided networking, mentorship, and proof of arrival—but at what cost to authentic connection?

Derrick sought in The Boule what he'd found in NSBE: brotherhood, validation, belonging among Black men who understood the journey. But The Boule operated differently—more formal, more status-conscious, more about maintaining position than building community. The search for Black excellence revealed questions about what excellence meant and whether professional achievement created the bonds he craved.

**Key Events:**
- Investigation and application to join The Boule
- Sponsorship and vetting process
- Acceptance into Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity
- Attending Boule meetings and events
- Comparing Boule to NSBE experience
- Navigating class tensions within Black community
- Seeking validation and belonging among Black professionals

**Themes:**
- Black excellence and achievement
- Class divisions within Black America
- Professional organizations vs. authentic community
- Status and belonging
- Comparing different models of Black brotherhood
- Achievement as path to validation
- Formal institutions vs. organic community

## CHAPTER 21: Courts of Transformation

**Time Period:** 1989-present (30+ years of YMCA basketball)
**Narrator's Age:** 25-60 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, regular basketball player at YMCA)
- Wednesday Warriors: Steve Van, Jean-Claude Brunache, Tony Lindsay, Rick Navarro (30+ years of friendship)
- Other regular basketball players at San Mateo YMCA
- Younger players Derrick mentored
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, understanding the importance of basketball)

**Summary:**

For over 30 years, Derrick played basketball at the San Mateo YMCA. What began as exercise became ritual, community, and transformation. The basketball court was where Derrick could be purely present—no performance, no corporate politics, just bodies in motion, competition, camaraderie.

The Wednesday Warriors—Steve Van, Jean-Claude Brunache, Tony Lindsay, Rick Navarro—became brothers through decades of games. On the court, none of the usual hierarchies mattered. A good pass was a good pass regardless of who threw it. A blocked shot was a blocked shot. The game demanded presence, reading situations, responding authentically, trusting your teammates.

Basketball taught leadership differently than corporate environments. On the court, Derrick learned to mentor younger players, to read group dynamics, to balance competition with community. The court became a space of transformation—where the performative executive could become simply a player, where authentic connection happened through shared effort and mutual respect.

**Key Events:**
- Starting basketball at San Mateo YMCA (1989)
- Formation of Wednesday Warriors group
- 30+ years of consistent play
- Mentoring younger players on the court
- Learning authentic leadership through basketball
- Building lifelong friendships through sport
- Court as refuge from corporate performance
- Basketball as space of presence and authenticity

**Themes:**
- Sport as community building
- Authentic connection through shared activity
- Leadership through mentorship not hierarchy
- Male friendship and brotherhood
- Physical presence vs. mental performance
- Basketball court as sacred space
- Chosen family through sustained commitment
- Transformation through consistent practice

## CHAPTER 22: A Father's Love

**Time Period:** 1960s-2000 (Howard's life, stroke in 1995, death May 5, 2000)
**Narrator's Age:** 31 years old at Dad's death (born 1964, Dad died 2000)
**Key Characters:**
- Howard Burns (Dad, federal employee, photographer, bowler, tax preparer, stroke survivor)
- Willa Burns (Mom, dedicated caregiver)
- Derrick (narrator, adult son living in California)
- Dave (brother, also living away from Detroit)
- Uncle Bubba and Aunt Mildred (Florida relatives, winter hosts)
- Doctor Charles E. Morton (Metropolitan Baptist Church pastor since 1963)
- Uncle Bill (had Parkinson's, visited in nursing home)
- Aunt Net (Uncle Bill's wife)
- Nursing home staff at Bortz Health Care of Warren
- Home health aides
- Medical teams

**Summary:**

This chapter is a profound portrait of Howard Burns, revealing the man behind "Dad" through his routines, passions, and quiet dignity. Dad's left hand was quick and precise on the ping-pong table, never showing mercy because earning victory was the only way to truly appreciate it. That competitive fire, that insistence on earning everything, defined how Dad approached not just games, but life itself.

After retiring in 1986 (deliberately waiting until Derrick graduated Princeton), Dad maintained unwavering routines: 35 years at TACOM managing military and civilian payroll, bowling with the National Bowling Association (founded by Black bowlers in 1939 Detroit), preparing tax returns for neighbors for exactly $2 to preserve everyone's dignity. Dad came alive at the bowling alley—finding brotherhood, belonging completely. Numbers were Dad's language of care.

Dad studied thick IRS guidebooks on cheap newsprint with precision, turning tax preparation into service. Young Derrick absorbed his first accounting lessons watching Dad decode how the world worked through forms and calculations. For both, pencil-and-paper arithmetic told its story by hand.

Prostate cancer struck shortly after retirement (1986)—radioactive implant and Lupron therapy brought remission. Nine years of borrowed normalcy. Then December 1995: massive stroke in K-Mart parking lot, 2.2 miles from home. Derrick flew to Detroit, tried reading Stephen Covey's "7 Habits" in the hospital waiting room: "Seek first to understand, then to be understood." He couldn't focus. "I did not understand why my Dad was fighting for his life. My hero didn't deserve this."

Dad survived weeks in a coma, woke paralyzed on his dominant left side. Mom stayed by his side day and night. Hospital care couldn't last forever—Dad needed round-the-clock attention. With immense reluctance, Mom moved him to Bortz Health Care of Warren, 6.2 miles from home. When Dad awakened, he understood his situation—helpless in strangers' care, paralyzed. With slurred speech, he cautioned Mom: "Willa, don't make a fuss. When you leave, I need these people."

The facility's conditions were grim: stench of urine, understaffed, men and women alone in rooms lying in waste. Mom demanded better care; overworked staff responded slowly. She cleaned Dad before Derrick arrived, desperately preserving his dignity. Derrick felt powerless, offered money—Mom refused, insisting they could manage, reminding him he had his own family.

Ten months after the stroke, Mom brought Dad home. She'd hired construction to transform the den into wheelchair-accessible bedroom with private attached bathroom. The adjacent back bedroom became her listening post, close enough to hear every sound, every shift in his breathing. She equipped the room with adjustable hospital bed, wheelchair, ADA-compliant ramp to new back door.

Mom modeled true commitment and love. While her friends warehoused disabled husbands in distant nursing homes, Mom chose differently. Home care was exorbitantly expensive—their combined pensions (State of Michigan and U.S. federal government) weren't enough without significant adjustments. "We can make it," Mom insisted when Derrick offered money. She clipped every coupon, drove across town for adult diaper sales, made trips to agencies supplying free medical equipment to elderly and sick.

Derrick started tracking their finances in Quicken. "Derrick is here," Mom would announce proudly. "He is taking care of my money." It gave him safe routine, something concrete in overwhelming situations—a role that didn't require navigating emotional depths.

Mom—4'11"—would wrestle Dad's 160-pound paralyzed frame from wheelchair to car for appointments when no aide was available, body straining against dead weight, sweat beading, hands shaking. "I've got this," she'd tell herself. When hospitals offered week of respite care, Mom's relief was visible—shoulders dropping, genuine smile for first time in months.

Through hardship, Mom created normalcy, culminating in a 40th Wedding Anniversary party (August 1999) with sit-down formal dinner. For five years, they built a new life within disability's confines—Mom's commands, Dad's compliance, small victories in successful bed-to-wheelchair transfers. They found their rhythm again.

Until the cancer returned. In 2000, five years after the stroke, prostate cancer spread to lymph nodes. Mom and Dad carried the truth privately, shielding Dave and Derrick.

May 5, 2000: Mom called, voice trembling—Dad was in hospice, Derrick needed to come home. Flight delayed, prolonging agony. Derrick landed 11 PM, rented car, sped home, arriving just after midnight. Placing key in the side door he always used, he felt stillness inside. Mom didn't hear him enter. Walking to her bedroom, afraid like as a child in the dark basement—but this wasn't the boogeyman. It was something colder, emptier. In his heart, he knew.

He stepped inside to silence like a wall. Called out "I'm home!" hoping to pierce stillness. The phone rang—jarring, cutting through like a knife. A nurse from St. John's Hospital: Dad had just died.

"The words stopped me cold. Time stilled around me. I stood there, in the home that held so many memories. My rock, my hero. The left hand that once guided a tax pencil and a ping pong paddle was gone."

- 40th Wedding Anniversary party (August 1999)
- 2000: cancer returns, spreads to lymph nodes
- May 5, 2000: Dad dies in hospice while Derrick is in flight

**Themes:**
- Dignity in disability and caregiving
- Love expressed through service and sacrifice
- Working-class Black family managing medical crisis
- The ping-pong paddle and tax pencil as symbols of Dad's character
- Numbers as language of care
- Devastating loss of father-hero
- Mom's extraordinary devotion (5 years of caregiving)
- Healthcare system's inadequacies
- The unspoken lessons fathers teach sons
- Death arriving when son is unreachable

## CHAPTER 23: A Mother's Farewell

**Time Period:** 2000-2010 (Mom's cancer battle, caregiving, death, house loss)
**Narrator's Age:** 36-46 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Willa Burns (Mom, cancer patient, dies 2010)
- Derrick (narrator, adult son, caregiver)
- Dave (brother, caregiver)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, supporting Derrick)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Marcia (ongoing complicated relationship)
- Medical team
- Church community at Metropolitan Baptist
- Creditors and mortgage companies

**Summary:**

After losing Howard in 2000, Willa faced her own health crisis. Cancer struck, demanding the same fierce determination she'd shown caring for Dad. But now she was alone in the Shields Street house, and her sons lived across the country. Derrick and Dave tried to provide care from a distance, but it was inadequate to the need.

Mom's battle with cancer lasted years. Derrick watched the woman who'd orchestrated "The Project" for his success, who'd brought Dad home and cared for him for five years, now struggling with her own mortality. The role reversal was painful—the mother who'd always been strong, always been the caregiver, now needed care herself.

Financially, the burden was crushing. The house that had been paid off became leveraged again for medical expenses. Church community rallied, but it wasn't enough. As Mom's health declined, so did the family's financial stability. When she died in 2010, the house—the physical anchor of Derrick's childhood, witness to decades of life—was lost to creditors.

The title "A Mother's Farewell" captures both Mom's death and the loss of the family home. Willa's passing meant losing not just a parent but the family's Detroit foundation, the Shields Street address that had been home for so many years. With both parents gone and the house lost, a chapter of life closed completely.

**Key Events:**
- Mom's cancer diagnosis (sometime after 2000)
- Years of cancer treatment and decline
- Derrick and Dave's attempts to provide care from California
- Financial burden of medical expenses
- Leveraging the house for medical care
- Church community support
- Mom's death (2010)
- Loss of family house to creditors

- Closing of childhood home chapter

**Themes:**
- Parental decline and role reversal
- Long-distance caregiving challenges
- Financial devastation of medical crisis
- Losing family home and anchor
- Mother's strength in facing death
- Guilt and inadequacy of adult children
- End of an era with both parents gone
- Material loss compounding emotional loss
- Church community as support system

## CHAPTER 24: Colliding Worlds

**Time Period:** 2010 (Mom's funeral)
**Narrator's Age:** 46 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, grieving son)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, at funeral)
- Marcia (appears at funeral, creating crisis)
- Maya Burns (daughter, witnessing collision)
- Jamil Burns (son, witnessing collision)
- Dave/Jala (brother, at funeral)
- Metropolitan Baptist Church community
- Extended family and friends

**Summary:**

Mom's funeral in 2010 should have been a time for family to grieve together and celebrate Willa Burns's remarkable life. Instead, it became the collision Derrick had been avoiding for over a decade. Marcia appeared at the funeral, and the worlds Derrick had kept carefully separated crashed together.

Gina, Maya, and Jamil—the family Derrick had built—encountered Marcia, the relationship Derrick had hidden. The children saw their father's betrayal made manifest. Gina faced public humiliation in the space where her mother-in-law was being mourned. The church community witnessed family crisis unfolding in real time.

The collision was devastating. All of Derrick's sophisticated performance, all his careful compartmentalization, all his ability to manage different identities in different contexts—none of it worked when the contexts collided. He couldn't be the grieving son, the faithful husband, and Marcia's partner simultaneously in the same space. The performance shattered.

The chapter represents the cost of living divided. Derrick had believed he could manage separate lives, separate loves, separate versions of himself. The funeral proved the impossibility. When worlds collide, someone gets hurt—in this case, everyone.

**Key Events:**
- Mom's funeral at Metropolitan Baptist Church (2010)
- Marcia's appearance at funeral
- Gina's public humiliation
- Maya and Jamil witnessing father's betrayal
- Family crisis unfolding at Mom's memorial
- Church community witnessing collision
- Shattering of Derrick's carefully managed separate lives
- Devastating consequences of divided life

**Themes:**
- Consequences of betrayal made public
- Performance's ultimate failure
- Colliding worlds and shattered compartmentalization
- Public humiliation and private grief
- Children witnessing parental failure
- Cost of living divided
- Crisis at moment of vulnerability
- Family bonds tested by betrayal

## CHAPTER 25: Searching for Black Excellence (The Boule)

**Time Period:** 2000-2010
**Narrator's Age:** 36-46 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, Boule member)
- Fellow Boule members (Black professional men)
- Sponsors and mentors
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)

**Summary:**

[Note: This appears to be a continuation or alternate version of Chapter 20's Boule content, possibly exploring it in more depth during the 2000-2010 period when Derrick was dealing with his parents' illnesses, his relationship with Marcia, and his career struggles. The chapter likely examines how The Boule functioned during this crisis period—whether it provided support, whether it was another performance space, how Black professional excellence intersected with personal crisis.]

**Key Events:**
- Active participation in The Boule during crisis decade
- Boule meetings and events
- Networking and professional connections through organization
- Contrast between public success/status and private turmoil
- Using Boule membership as validation amid personal chaos

**Themes:**

## CHAPTER 26: Dave Becomes Jala

**Time Period:** Timeline unclear, likely 2000s-2010s
**Narrator's Age:** 40s-50s
**Key Characters:**
- Dave Burns (narrator's brother, transitioning)
- Jala McKenzie-Burns (Dave's name after transition)
- Derrick (narrator, learning to support sibling's transition)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Willa Burns (Mom, if still alive during transition; reaction to Dave's transition)

**Summary:**

Brother Dave announced a transition that would fundamentally change their sibling relationship and family identity. Dave became Jala McKenzie-Burns, embracing authentic gender identity after decades of living in a body and identity that didn't fit.

For Derrick, this was both revelation and challenge. The brother he'd grown up with, the other adopted mixed-race child in the Burns family, was now his sister. Jala's courage in transitioning—choosing authenticity over comfort, truth over performance—stood in stark contrast to Derrick's own pattern of performing different identities.

Jala's transition taught Derrick about authentic courage. While Derrick had spent decades perfecting performance, Jala was willing to lose everything to live truthfully. The sibling who'd seemed more rebellious, less compliant with parental expectations, turned out to be braver than Derrick in the way that mattered most: being genuinely yourself.

The chapter title "Dave Becomes Jala" marks transformation, but it's not just Jala who changes. Derrick must learn new ways of seeing, supporting, and understanding his sibling. Jala's authenticity becomes a mirror showing Derrick his own patterns of performance and hiding.

**Key Events:**
- Dave's announcement of gender transition
- Becoming Jala McKenzie-Burns
- Family adjusting to Jala's authentic identity
- Derrick learning to support and understand
- Jala's courage in choosing authenticity
- Contrast between Jala's courage and Derrick's performance patterns
- Sibling relationship transformed and deepened

**Themes:**
- Gender transition and authentic identity
- Courage to live truthfully
- Family acceptance and growth
- Performance vs. authenticity (contrast between siblings)
- Chosen identity and chosen family
- Jala's bravery as mirror for Derrick's performance
- Love transcending gender transition

---

## CHAPTER 27: Holding On

**Time Period:** 2010-2022 (Jala's health decline)
**Narrator's Age:** 46-58 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Jala McKenzie-Burns (Derrick's sister, dealing with health crisis)
- Derrick (narrator, watching sibling's decline)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Medical team
- Friends supporting Jala

**Summary:**

After Dave became Jala, celebrating authentic identity, health challenges emerged that would define the next decade. Jala faced serious illness—the specifics less important than the arc of decline, hope, setback, resilience, and eventual deterioration.

Derrick watched his sibling fight with the same courage Jala had shown in transitioning. "Holding On" captures both Jala's determination to survive and the family's desperate hope that modern medicine could save her. After losing both parents, the idea of losing Jala—the only person who shared Derrick's exact origin story, the other adopted mixed-race Burns child—was unbearable.

Over twelve years, Jala's health waxed and waned. Good periods brought hope; setbacks brought despair. Derrick, now living in California with his own family and career, tried to support from a distance while managing his own life's demands. The helplessness he'd felt during Dad's stroke and Mom's cancer returned, amplified by the fact that this was his sibling, his contemporary, his mirror.

Through it all, Jala maintained the authenticity that had characterized the transition. Even facing death, Jala refused to retreat into performance or pretense. The courage that had enabled living truthfully now enabled facing mortality honestly. Derrick was learning what authentic presence looked like, even as he struggled to provide it himself.

**Key Events:**
- Jala's serious health crisis emerges (sometime after 2010)
- Twelve years of health challenges (2010-2022)
- Cycles of hope and setback
- Derrick's long-distance support and helplessness
- Medical treatments and interventions
- Jala's courage in facing illness
- Family holding on to hope
- Derrick learning from Jala's authentic presence

**Themes:**
- Prolonged illness and medical crisis
- Sibling bonds tested by health challenges
- Courage in facing mortality
- Authenticity in crisis
- Helplessness of watching loved one decline
- Distance and inadequate support
- Hope and despair cycles
- Learning presence through witness

## CHAPTER 28: Letting Go

**Time Period:** Late 2022-December 2023 (Jala's final decline and death)
**Narrator's Age:** 58-59 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Jala McKenzie-Burns (Derrick's sister, dying)
- Derrick (narrator, learning to let go)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, supporting Derrick)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Medical team and hospice workers
- Friends gathering for Jala's final days

**Summary:**

After twelve years of holding on, it became clear that Jala wouldn't survive. The final decline was swift—hospice care, final days, family gathering. "Letting Go" meant accepting the unacceptable: Jala was dying, and no amount of hoping, praying, or medical intervention could change it.

Derrick faced losing the person who shared his foundational story. Two mixed-race babies adopted by the Burns family in Detroit, two children who grew up between worlds—now only one would remain. Jala's death meant Derrick becoming the sole keeper of their shared memories, their unique sibling bond, their parallel journeys from adoption through adulthood.

The death occurred in December 2023, shortly before Derrick's own cancer diagnosis. The timing was devastatingly compressed: grief for Jala barely begun when Derrick faced his own mortality. Letting go of Jala taught painful lessons about control, acceptance, and presence that would serve him in his own health crisis weeks later.

Jala's death in December 2023 closed the circle of Derrick's original family. Both parents gone, now his sibling too. Only Derrick remained of the four who'd lived on Shields Street, who'd shared that particular configuration of adoption, race, identity, and Detroit. The letting go was both specific (Jala's death) and existential (the end of his origin family).

**Key Events:**
- Jala's final health decline (late 2022-2023)
- Move to hospice care
- Family gathering for final days
- Derrick's presence during Jala's dying
- Jala's death (December 2023)
- Becoming sole survivor of Burns family
- Grief compounded by timing (own cancer diagnosis coming)
- Final lessons from Jala about authenticity and courage

**Themes:**
- Death and letting go
- Sibling loss and grief
- End of origin family
- Sole survivor burden
- Presence in face of death
- Authenticity until the end
- Timing of losses (Jala's death, then own cancer)
- Learning acceptance through loss

- Recent memory of Jala's death (December 2023 - note: timeline suggests Jala died shortly AFTER diagnosis, not before)

**Summary:**

November 2023: Cancer. The diagnosis arrived shortly before or shortly after Jala's death (the timeline is compressed), creating a devastating one-two punch. Derrick, at 59, faced mortality not as abstract future but as immediate present. The disease that had killed Dad (prostate cancer spreading to lymph nodes) now threatened Derrick himself.

The diagnosis was terrifying partly because Derrick had just witnessed Jala's twelve-year health battle ending in death. He'd also lived through Dad's stroke and Mom's cancer. He knew what decline looked like, what caregiving demanded, what families endured. Now he faced being patient rather than witness.

The medical team—Doctor Daniel Greenwood, Doctor Christopher Tang, Doctor Jed Katzel—delivered news with expertise and compassion. But no amount of medical sophistication changed the fundamental reality: Derrick's life was threatened. Treatment would be difficult, outcome uncertain, transformation inevitable.

"The Diagnosis" marked the beginning of Derrick's most profound transformation. Everything that came before—all the performance, all the achievement, all the carefully managed identities—suddenly mattered less than simply surviving. Cancer stripped away pretense, leaving only the essential question: Who was Derrick when all performance became impossible?

**Key Events:**
- Cancer diagnosis (November 2023)
- Medical team consultations with Greenwood, Tang, Katzel
- Telling Gina, Maya, and Jamil about diagnosis
- Processing diagnosis amid grief for Jala
- Facing mortality at age 59

**Themes:**
- Mortality and diagnosis shock
- Stripping away of pretense
- Essential self revealed in crisis
- Medical system and expertise
- Family support in facing death
- Dad's cancer legacy
- Crisis as transformation beginning
- Loss of control and certainty

## CHAPTER 30: A Problem to Overcome

**Time Period:** Late 2023-early 2024 (treatment decision period)
**Narrator's Age:** 59 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, approaching cancer treatment strategically)
- Doctor Daniel Greenwood, Doctor Christopher Tang, Doctor Jed Katzel (medical team)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, partner in decision-making)
- Maya Burns (daughter, supporting father)
- Jamil Burns (son, supporting father)
- Medical researchers and treatment planners

**Summary:**

Derrick's initial response to cancer was to treat it as he'd treated every other challenge in his life: as a problem to be solved through research, analysis, and strategic thinking. He approached treatment decisions like a technology project—gathering data, evaluating options, building decision matrices, consulting experts.

This was familiar territory: achievement-oriented problem-solving, taking control through analysis, demonstrating competence in face of crisis. Derrick read medical studies, questioned doctors, sought second opinions, third opinions. He wanted to understand the algorithm of cancer treatment so he could optimize the outcome.

But the chapter title's irony becomes clear: cancer isn't just "a problem to overcome" through brilliance and effort. It's a physical reality that demands surrender as much as strategy, presence as much as planning, acceptance as much as action. The approach that had served Derrick throughout his life—technical mastery, strategic thinking, performance excellence—was necessary but not sufficient.

The medical team worked with Derrick's analytical approach while gently suggesting that healing would require more than problem-solving. Gina, Maya, and Jamil watched him try to control the uncontrollable, to achieve his way out of mortality, to perform his way past fear. The chapter captures both the value and the limits of Derrick's lifelong strategy.

**Key Events:**
- Researching treatment options extensively
- Medical consultations and second opinions
- Decision-making process about treatment approach
- Building strategic approach to cancer like tech problem
- Family supporting while watching him try to control
- Doctors providing expertise and gentle reality checks
- Choosing treatment protocol
- Beginning to recognize limits of analytical approach

**Themes:**
- Control vs. surrender
- Problem-solving approach to mortality
- Limits of analytical thinking
- Medical decision-making
- Family as partners in crisis
- Performance patterns in health crisis
- Recognizing what can't be controlled
- Strategic thinking meets bodily reality

## CHAPTER 31: The Battle

**Time Period:** 2024 (treatment period)
**Narrator's Age:** 59-60 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, undergoing cancer treatment)
- Doctor Daniel Greenwood, Doctor Christopher Tang, Doctor Jed Katzel (medical team)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, primary caregiver)
- Maya Burns (daughter, supporting father)
- Jamil Burns (son, supporting father)
- Nurses and medical staff
- Friends and support network

**Summary:**

Treatment was brutal. "The Battle" captures both the military metaphor commonly applied to cancer (fighting, battling, defeating) and the physical reality of treatment's assault on the body. Chemotherapy, radiation, side effects, weight loss, weakness, nausea—the arsenal aimed at cancer damaged everything else too.

Derrick lost significant weight. Food became difficult. Energy disappeared. The man who'd prided himself on physical capability—30+ years of basketball, professional competence, independence—became dependent on others for basic needs. Gina stepped into caregiver role, repeating the dedication Willa had shown Howard, but with their own partnership dynamics.

The battle metaphor proved both useful and limiting. It gave Derrick framework for enduring treatment—he was fighting, therefore each day of treatment was victory. But it also suggested outcome dependent on effort and will, when the reality was more complex: bodies respond to treatment in their own ways, regardless of patient's determination.

Maya and Jamil watched their father become vulnerable in ways they'd never seen. The man who'd performed strength and competence now couldn't hide weakness. This vulnerability—unwanted, unavoidable—became teaching moment more powerful than decades of intentional parenting. Sometimes becoming real means being broken.

**Key Events:**
- Beginning intensive cancer treatment
- Severe weight loss and physical decline
- Side effects: nausea, fatigue, weakness
- Gina's caregiving (echoing Willa's care of Howard)
- Losing physical capabilities and independence
- Maya and Jamil witnessing father's vulnerability
- Medical team's support through treatment
- Fighting as daily act of survival

**Themes:**
- Physical devastation of cancer treatment
- Vulnerability and dependence
- Caregiving and partnership
- Battle metaphors for illness
- Will vs. bodily reality
- Family witnessing transformation
- Breaking down of performance through physical crisis
- Gina as caregiver echoing Mom's devotion

## CHAPTER 32: The Triumph

**Time Period:** Mid-late 2024 (recovery period)
**Narrator's Age:** 60 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, recovering from cancer)
- Doctor Daniel Greenwood, Doctor Christopher Tang, Doctor Jed Katzel (medical team delivering good news)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, celebrating recovery)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Friends and support network
- Basketball community at YMCA

**Summary:**

The treatment worked. "The Triumph" celebrates both medical success (cancer in remission, treatment effective) and personal transformation. Derrick survived, but the man emerging from treatment was different from the one who entered it.

The triumph wasn't just surviving cancer—it was discovering who he was without performance. Cancer had stripped away everything he'd used to construct identity: professional achievement, physical capability, careful image management, control. What remained when all that was gone? A man learning, finally, to be present rather than impressive.

Recovery meant reconnecting—with Gina, with Maya and Jamil, with the basketball community, with himself. But connection now came from vulnerability rather than strength, from authenticity rather than performance. The triumph was recognizing that being broken had made him whole in ways achievement never could.

The medical team's expertise had given him years; their humanity had given him hope. But the real triumph was internal: choosing presence over performance, choosing authenticity over approval, choosing to be real rather than right. At sixty, Derrick was finally becoming the person his children had been all along—fearlessly authentic.

**Key Events:**
- Positive medical results (remission/successful treatment)
- Physical recovery and regaining strength
- Emotional and psychological transformation
- Reconnecting with Gina, Maya, Jamil from place of authenticity
- Returning to basketball at YMCA (different relationship to it)
- Recognizing who he is without performance
- Gratitude to medical team
- Celebration of life and second chance

**Themes:**
- Triumph through transformation, not just survival
- Recovery as opportunity for reinvention
- Presence vs. performance
- Vulnerability as strength
- Authenticity earned through breaking
- Family bonds deepened by crisis
- Medical triumph and human transformation
- Second chances and wisdom

## CHAPTER 33: Full Circle

**Time Period:** Late 2024
**Narrator's Age:** 60 years old
**Key Characters:**
- Derrick (narrator, reflecting on career and life)
- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, partner in life reckoning)
- Maya Burns (daughter)
- Jamil Burns (son)
- Career mentors and colleagues
- Willie Hooks (mentor mentioned in acknowledgments)
- Wednesday Warriors (basketball friends)

**Summary:**

"Full Circle" suggests return and completion. At sixty, having survived cancer and lost his entire origin family (Willa, Howard, Jala), Derrick looked back at his career and life with new perspective. What had all the striving been for? What had he actually achieved versus what he'd been chasing?

The chapter likely examines career reckoning—the decades in Silicon Valley, the companies he'd worked for, the titles he'd held, the achievements he'd accumulated. From the vantage point of mortality faced and survived, did those achievements matter in the ways he'd thought they did? What legacy was he actually building?

The full circle might also refer to returning to lessons available all along but only now understood. Aunt Mae's unconditional acceptance, Dad's quiet dignity, Mom's fierce devotion, Jala's authentic courage, Gina's patient love, Maya and Jamil's fearless presence—the teachers had always been there. Cancer gave him eyes to finally see.

The chapter represents integration: Silicon Valley executive and adopted Detroit boy, technical expert and human being, achievement-focused and presence-centered. Full circle meant recognizing all the parts of himself, honoring all the journeys, accepting all the contradictions without needing to resolve them into single narrative.

**Key Events:**
- Career reflection and reckoning at age 60
- Evaluating decades of Silicon Valley achievement
- Recognizing what matters vs. what he chased
- Integration of all life experiences and identities
- Understanding lessons that were always available
- Seeing teachers who'd been present all along
- Coming to terms with multiple truths about his life

**Themes:**
- Career and life reckoning
- Achievement vs. meaning
- Integration of multiple identities
- Wisdom earned through crisis
- Seeing with new eyes
- Legacy questions
- Accepting contradictions
- Full circle as recognition, not return

## CHAPTER 34: Fearless Love

**Time Period:** Spring/Summer 2024
**Narrator's Age:** 60 years old
**Key Characters:**

- Gina Gregory-Burns (wife, partner)
- Maya Burns Benard (daughter, 34 years old, organized family gathering)
- Jamil Burns (son, cooking breakfast with devotion)
- Jasmine Gregory (cousin, artist with solo exhibition at MoMA PS1)
- Elliot Aronson (92-year-old professor who knew Burton, Derrick's birth father)
- Burton (birth father, Harvard student in 1960-61, remembered by Aronson)
- Brendan (Elliot Aronson's great-nephew, Maya's business school classmate)
- Other family members at Queens gathering

**Summary:**

The memoir concludes in a cramped Queens Airbnb kitchen during a family gathering celebrating cousin Jasmine Gregory's solo exhibition "Who Wants to Die for Glamour" at MoMA PS1. Jamil commanded the small kitchen with focused intensity, making scrambled eggs with caramelized shallots, French toast soaked in vanilla custard, fresh fruit in careful patterns. "This was Jamil's love language—and he was fluent."

Four adults crowded around a small table—Derrick, Gina, Maya, Jamil—in a space meant for quick breakfast, but it felt exactly right. They were there because Maya (34) had crafted a multi-day itinerary for family to gather across three time zones to pay homage to Jasmine, now a major artist in Geneva. Maya had taken it upon herself to organize this reunion.

At Jasmine's exhibition the day before, Derrick studied the paintings with pride. One featured a boy piloting a boat as his father hovered over him, guiding him to accept his place among owners of finest things and inheritance of membership in the top caste. Derrick chuckled—the meaning was clear to him. When he asked family members how they interpreted the pieces, most were silent, summarizing it as "abstract." "Artists see things differently than us," one offered. Perhaps, but Derrick felt it deeply. When he suggested his interpretation to Jasmine, she responded: "Exactly," in a way that suggested it should be obvious.

Maya was glowing, having orchestrated this family gathering around Jasmine's triumph—that particular happiness that comes from being exactly where you want to be with exactly the people you want to be with.

"Oh, Dad," she said, cutting into Jamil's French toast. "I meant to tell you earlier. Remember that article I sent you? The one co-authored by your birth father?" Derrick nodded, fork paused. The 1962 research paper on communicator credibility—dry academic work he'd filed away. "Well, I reached out to the other author. Elliot Aronson. He's ninety-two now, lives in Santa Cruz."

Derrick's fork completed its journey but he barely tasted Jamil's creation. "You... reached out to him?"

"Through his website. I found out we have a connection—his great-nephew Brendan was in my business school class." Maya's voice carried that same fearless confidence she'd displayed her entire life—the tone she'd used at eight announcing she'd dive off the ten-meter platform despite never having done anything higher than three meters.

"He wrote back," she continued, pulling out her phone. "Want to hear what he said?"

Before Derrick could answer, she was reading: "'Dear Maya, Wow! How exciting. I was very fond of Burton, a smart, courageous young man. We worked together in 1960-61 when I was a new assistant professor at Harvard. Your grandfather was taking my class on social influence, and our publication marked my first collaboration with an undergraduate...'"

Burton—the abstract figure Derrick had carried as a question mark his entire life—suddenly had dimension. Had presence.

"'He was one of the few black students at Harvard at that time,'" Maya continued, "'even conducting a study on prejudice. Burton had approached me to collaborate, and together they ran an experiment... His resilience, using Jackie Robinson as a model, left a lasting impression...'"

The kitchen went quiet except for gentle sizzle from Jamil's pan. Derrick could feel family eyes on him, but he was somewhere else entirely—seeing Burton as a young man not much older than Maya was now, walking across Harvard Yard in 1960, carrying himself with the kind of courage that left impressions on professors decades later.

"This brings tears to my eyes," Derrick heard himself say, voice thick. "Burton was such a bright light, full of passion for learning and life. I was the same at that age, yearning to contribute to humanity. I feel a deep sadness that he felt he had to extinguish that light."

The tears came—not controlled kind he'd learned to manage, but real ones that surprise you with intensity. Jamil reached across the table, hand finding Derrick's shoulder. Gina's fingers intertwined with his.

But it was Maya he couldn't stop looking at. Maya, who had fearlessly reached across sixty years to connect him with something he didn't even know he needed. Just like she'd fearlessly launched herself off that diving platform, trusting the water would catch her. Just like she'd fearlessly charged toward fly balls in right field, diving at full speed without hesitation, or thrown out runners from her knees with perfect accuracy and total confidence.

While Derrick had spent decades learning to drop his performance and connect authentically, Maya had been living that way all along. And now she was using that fearless love to heal parts of him he hadn't even known were broken.

Derrick looked around that cramped Queens kitchen—at Jamil, who had poured his soul into feeding them; at Maya, who had poured her courage into connecting him with his history; at Gina, who had poured three decades into helping him become someone worthy of this moment.

For the first time, he truly understood what it meant to be surrounded by fearless love. And he realized that his children hadn't learned authenticity despite his years of performance—they had learned it from watching him finally become himself.

The tears kept coming, but they felt like gratitude now. Gratitude for a daughter brave enough to dive deep, and a son who knew that love tastes like perfectly caramelized shallots and vanilla-scented French toast, served with absolute devotion on a Sunday morning in Queens.

The memoir concludes with acknowledgments thanking Gina, June Cross (editor), Maya and Jamil, Jala, Paige Wolfson, Wednesday Warriors, Vince Nakayama, James Raby, Willie Hooks, basketball community, medical team, high school buddies, Jamal Mazrui, and The Sign—that faithful witness in the basement whose question took sixty years to fully answer.

The back cover summary reveals the memoir's structure: "More than an adoption story, From Walls to Bridges is a masterwork of contemporary memoir—a sophisticated three-act journey that transforms individual struggle into universal wisdom about identity, belonging, and the radical power of chosen family."
