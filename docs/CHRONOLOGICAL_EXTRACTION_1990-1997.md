2. Birth search years: silent resignation
3. Finding Marcia: helps search online

## QUESTIONS FOR PARALLEL NARRATIVE RESTRUCTURE

### Structure Questions:
1. **How to handle duplicates?**
   - Use Ch 21 for career detail (much richer than Ch 15/20)
   - Ch 15/20 "Becoming Real" focuses on family/identity, less career detail
   - Keep both but reduce overlap?

2. **How to integrate threads chronologically?**
   - Birth search has clear dates
   - Career has some dates (1993 Time Warner, 1994 Netscape, 1995 peak)
   - Family has some dates (births, Christmas 1995, bunk bed June 1995)
   - Marcia relationship mostly 1997 but extends beyond

3. **What about content extending beyond 1997?**
   - Chapter 19 continues years beyond 1997
   - Genealogy conflict, Christmas card conflict, email about Maya, Gina's "I'm done," Cara's distancing
   - Include or save for later period?

### Content Questions:
1. **Fill gaps?**
   - 1991 under-covered
   - Dave/Jala transition not narratively addressed
   - Dissertation abandoned?
   - Virage outcome?

2. **Expand synchronicities?**
   - Maya's birth triggering search deserves more
   - Sabbatical as career/search intersection
   - Christmas 1995 as convergence of all threads

3. **Gina's perspective?**
   - She's present in all threads
   - Carries burden across all
   - Her arc mostly shown through Derrick's (belated) recognition
   - Needs more voice?

## RECOMMENDED PARALLEL NARRATIVE STRUCTURE

### Option 1: Strict Chronological (Month by Month)
- Interweave all threads as they actually happened
- Show how obsessions overlap and family suffers
- Risk: choppy, hard to follow emotional arcs

### Option 2: Thread-Based with Crossover Moments
- Each chapter follows one thread chronologically
- Special "synchronicity" sections where threads intersect
- Clearer arcs per thread
- Risk: loses sense of simultaneous pressure

### Option 3: Hybrid (Recommended)
- Anchor each section in specific TIME PERIOD
- Within period, show all active threads
- Emphasize synchronicity moments
- Example structure:
  - **1990-1992: Becoming a Father While Searching** (Maya birth triggers search, Jamil born, SGI success, family strain begins)
  - **1993-1994: Building Tomorrow, Missing Today** (Time Warner peak, Netscape decision, leadership befuddlement, family disconnection deepens)
  - **1995-1996: Convergence** (Christmas depression, search reignites, SGI decline, all threads in crisis)
  - **1997: Discovery** (Birth search success, Marcia relationship, SGI firing, sabbatical pivot)

## TOTAL CONTENT INVENTORY

### Dated Scenes: 47
### Undated Scenes/Sections: 23

## NEXT STEPS FOR RESTRUCTURING

1. **Decide on duplicate handling**
   - Keep Ch 21 career detail
   - Trim Ch 15/20 SGI section to avoid redundancy
   - Or: merge best of both

2. **Extend timeline forward**
   - Chapter 19 extends well beyond 1997
   - Need to extract post-1997 Marcia content separately?

3. **Fill identified gaps**
   - Query author about 1991 period
   - Dave/Jala transition narrative
   - Dissertation outcome
   - Virage interview outcome

4. **Expand synchronicity moments**
   - Maya birth → search trigger (deeper)
   - Sabbatical as pivot point
   - Christmas 1995 convergence
   - July 4, 1997 integration

5. **Determine chapter breaks for parallel structure**
   - By year?
   - By theme/crisis?
   - By synchronicity moments?
   - Hybrid approach?
