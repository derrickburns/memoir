- All three threads in motion: Family crisis, career at peak (but beginning decline), search reigniting

### Chapter Arc:
**Convergence:** Depression under covers + SGI peak + Search reignites = "That I was a failure"
**Emotional Movement:** Despair (Christmas) → Peak (SGI cap) → Investment (Ken's mentorship) → Confrontation (anger) → Breakthrough (bunk bed) → Retreat (search resumes)
**Through-Line:** Success in one area (SGI market cap, Ken's investment) doesn't resolve identity crisis; children's independence enables escape into obsession

## SUMMARY: Eight-Chapter Arc (1990-1997)

### Narrative Structure:
**Ch 15:** Probate letter + Maya's birth = Search triggered
**Ch 16:** Law library + Jamil's birth + Time Warner = Juggling identities
**Ch 17:** Netflix-before-Netflix + Netscape decision = Excellence can't buy belonging
**Ch 18:** Christmas depression + SGI peak + Search reignites = "That I was a failure"
**Ch 19:** Career decline + Netscape regret + Birth father dead = Everything falling apart
**Ch 20:** Sabbatical + Detroit library + Yearbook photo = Career break enables identity breakthrough
**Ch 21:** Letter exchange + First meeting + July 4 photo = Independence Day irony
**Ch 22:** Marcia obsession + Marriage strain + SGI exit = Cost of finding yourself

### Total Word Count Estimate: 25,000-28,000 words
(Compared to current ~25,300 words across duplicate chapters)

### Synchronicity Moments Highlighted:
1. **Ch 15:** Maya's birth same year as probate letter (biological mirror triggers search)
2. **Ch 16:** Building streaming video while researching past (law library between coding)
3. **Ch 17:** Technical brilliance can't find birth father (irony explicit through juxtaposition)
4. **Ch 18:** All three crises converging - depression, SGI peak, search reignites
5. **Ch 19:** Career falling apart as search intensifies (SGI dying, birth father dead)
6. **Ch 20:** Career sabbatical enables search breakthrough (both identity crises)
7. **Ch 21:** Independence Day - finding birth family while current family waits
8. **Ch 22:** New mother relationship damaging marriage (pattern of obsession)

### Through-Lines Strengthened:
- **Finding Oneself:** Not just birth parents, but professional identity, parental identity, authentic self
- **Conditional vs. Unconditional Love:** Birth mother left, Marcia's conditional acceptance, Gina's strained love
- **Performance vs. Presence:** Performing at SGI while absent from search, present for Marcia while absent from kids
- **Walls to Bridges:** Searching alone (walls) vs. sharing with Gina (bridges she kept trying to build)
- **Obsession Pattern:** Coding → Burton search → Marcia relationship (all at family's expense)

### Irony Treatment (Per User Guidance: "Subtle. The reader should discover it like I did!"):
- **NOT explicit statements** like "The irony wasn't lost on me"
- **THROUGH JUXTAPOSITION:** Scenes placed next to each other reveal patterns
- **THROUGH STRUCTURE:** Chapter organization shows simultaneous pressures
- **THROUGH IMAGES:** July 4 photo, Gina's silhouette, kids waiting Christmas morning
- **THROUGH QUESTIONS:** Jamil's "How do I know you won't leave me too?" while Derrick searches for parents who left him
