## The Main Change Being Proposed

**Problem:** Dave's arrival (a life-changing event) gets only 2 sentences in current structure

**Solution:** Reorganize childhood from 7 chapters to 8 chapters, with Chapter 4 dedicated to Dave's arrival

**Files to Review:**
1. `proposed-reorganization/chapter_03_Refuge.txt` - Solo Aunt Mae (NEW)
2. `proposed-reorganization/chapter_04_Dave_Arrives.txt` - Full arrival story (NEW)
3. `proposed-reorganization/chapter_05_Shared_Refuge.txt` - Both boys together (NEW)
4. `proposed-reorganization/chapter_06_Two_Different_Boys.txt` - Different standards (NEW)

**Documentation:**
- `docs-analysis/DAVE_ARRIVAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation plan
