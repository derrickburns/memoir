# Session Checkpoint - Parallel Narrative Work

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Time:** Session start
**Current Task:** Writing parallel narrative chapters 15-22 (1990-1997)

---

## What We're Doing

Implementing **June Cross's bold suggestion** to interweave career and birth parent search timelines for 1990-1997.

**Why:** Creates synchronicity - reader discovers connections as Derrick did, rather than in separate sections.

---

## Progress on Chapters 15-22

**Structure:** 8 chapters covering 1990-1997, interweaving three threads:
1. **Career** (SGI peak → decline)
2. **Birth Parent Search** (Letter → finding both parents)
3. **Family** (Maya born → Jamil born → marriage strain)

## Key Principles for This Work

### Structural:
- **Chronological interweaving** - cut between threads naturally
- **Subtle irony** - reader discovers synchronicity (don't over-explain)
- **Show, don't tell** - concrete scenes, not summaries
- **"The reader should discover it like I did!"** - Derrick's directive

### Voice:
- **Direct, not evasive**
- **Concrete, not abstract**
- **Raw, not polished**
- **Scene-based, not summary**

### Quality Checklist (Every Chapter):
- [ ] Characters introduced with detail at first mention
- [ ] Time markers clear (elapsed time, not just dates)
- [ ] Important moments expanded (not dismissed in 3-4 paragraphs)
- [ ] Concrete details shown (not abstract emotions named)
- [ ] Through-lines advancing

## Session Progress Summary

**Chapters Completed:** 4 of 8 (Chapters 15-18)

**Key Learnings:**
- Must verify factual accuracy (Maya biological not adopted)
- Must maintain timeline consistency (Harvard/Michigan not known until 1997)
- Cut resume padding ruthlessly (SGI, Time Warner scenes)
- Show don't tell (concrete scenes over reflective summary)
- Remove clichés ("irony wasn't lost on me")
