> During tax season, Dad&#39;s love of numbers became an act of service. He prepared tax returns for friends and neighbors, charging exactly $2, not because the work wasn&#39;t worth more, but because that small fee transformed help into a transaction, preserving everyone&#39;s dignity. Numbers were Dad&#39;s language of care.
To prepare, he brought home thick IRS guidebooks printed on cheap newsprint, studying every rule and regulation with the same precision he brought to TACOM payrolls. I devoured those guidebooks alongside him, absorbing my first lessons in accounting while watching Dad decode how the world worked. His excitement for the logic of numbers was infectious, each form was a puzzle to solve, each calculation a way to help someone keep more of what they&#39;d earned.

**Comment:**

**Quoted text:**
> Dad came alive at the bowling alley. The strikes and spares mattered, but what truly drew him in was the brotherhood, a place where he belonged completely. He threw himself into leadership roles with The National Bowling Association, an organization founded in 1939 Detroit as black bowlers sought to build their own community around the sport they loved.
Bowling was beautifully democratic, inexpensive enough that class barriers fell away on the lanes. By 1944, when the group became the National Bowling Association, Inc., Dad was part of something powerful. These men and women were creating their own space, their own traditions, launching the &quot;Equality in Bowling&quot; campaign that opened doors across the sport in 1950.
For Dad, those long evenings at the lanes meant finding his tribe, men who understood both the weight of responsibility and the sweet satisfaction of knocking down pins that had no choice but to fall.

**Comment:**
somehow this feels like it should be closer to that anecdote you tell about you and Dave dawdling about coming to the dinner table and your Mom's reaction...it informs your Dad's character and maybe your Mom's jealousy

The work demanded meticulous attention to detail and a strong grasp of financial systems, qualities Dad possessed in abundance.

**Comment:**
why did you procrastinate? you were that distrustful of the folx around you?    and allthis is unfolding while you're going back and forth to Michigan while you're trying to find your birth parents?  I'm wondering what would happen if you actually put the real story side by side instead of compartmentalizing them from each other.  get some index cards (or use Google Slides) and put the chapters about trying to find your birth parents against the chapters of your career, and see what happens... there may be some synchronicity

> Meeting Marcia didn&#39;t just answer questions about my origins; it revealed patterns I&#39;d inherited or adopted. Her intense need for belonging mirrored my own. Her explosive responses to exclusion echoed my own tendencies to withdraw or classify people as enemies. Most revealing was recognizing my pattern of pouring myself into obsessions - coding, searching for Burton, now Marcia - as a way to avoid family responsibilities and emotional complexity.

and yet you also grew up in this loving family.  genetics can play a role - up to a point.   Then environment takes over.

so how long is this after that initial effort to meet her?  Important to keep your readers in time...the actual dates mean less than the time elapsed....I had to go back and figure - so this is a week later.  You mention earlier that you were on the way to New York for the weekend, so this is a trip you made the following week?

the family relationships are getting complicated.  You could add "They had twin daughters, Karen's nieces, Angela and Jennifer." (any reaction to learning you had sisters in addition to a brother?  And any supposition of what a rewritten childhood might have looked like?)

you may have already searched there, but Harvard's university archives keep copies of the class reports - every 5-10 years we are asked to write what's happening in our lives.  Since your dad died so soon after graduation he may not have bothered to submit, but it may be worth a look, if you're still interested

**Comment:**
I think you mean "resulted in"? or were these laws passed secretly and they discovered them?  that seems strange...laws by nature require public input.  Maybe you mean regulations?  A bit of clarity here would help.  Maybe a chronological telling would help even more - I gather the letter from Detroit Probate court came after your own sleuthing efforts? But the way this is written it seems like she sent it out of nowhere and that motivated you to search more....

but you do mention her first in this chapter, and then drop her.  Generally, the characters we meet first in a story - or in a chapter - set the stage for what follows.  Here, you've done a bait and switch.

> As I struggled through that return swim, I confronted a metaphor for my larger life journey. I had always been swimming between worlds, between my biological heritage and my adoptive family, between Detroit&#39;s streets and elite academic institutions, between theory and practice. The difference now was that Gina and her circle represented a potential shore, a place where I might finally stop swimming and simply belong.

**Comment:**
did this really happen while you were trying not to drown or does it just seem fitting here?  something about it feels a bit cloying...you haven't mentioned this struggle with belonging before: in your adoptive family, it's been about love and having a brother; at Princeton, it's been more compartmentalization and what do I want to be...this is a nice metaphor but needs more of a set up. when last we left you you seemed perfectly happy in that seminar room with Knuth and at peace working with SGI

this chapter on the whole feels more disjointed than the previous ones.  You have a picture from your wedding, but no mention of it in the text.  The kids are suddenly here ... we need a little handholding through these events...

> A Moment in History
Two weeks later, Gina and I were curled up together on her living room couch, eyes fixed on the TV screen. Jesse Jackson had captured an astounding 29.7% of the Democratic nomination vote, a seismic shift in American political possibilities. His Rainbow Coalition had built bridges across racial and economic divides, challenging conventional wisdom about what kind of leadership Americans would accept.

For black professionals like Gina and me, watching from her living room in 1988, Jackson&#39;s campaign wasn&#39;t just politics, it was personal validation. Here was a man who refused to code-switch or dilute his blackness to appeal to white voters. In a nation still grappling with the legacies of Reagan-era policies that had devastated many black communities, Jackson&#39;s prominence offered a powerful counter-narrative about black leadership and possibility.

I glanced at Gina, recognizing my own complicated emotions mirrored in her eyes. Here we were, two black professionals n…

maybe you should just refer to her this way in the chapter on Princeton.  Using the name opens a whole other box of worms....plus if this gets published you would need to get her permission (as well as others you have mentioned here)...publishers have a whole raft of legal bs they put you through.  I understand that may be why you're just using first names.

Clearly, &quot;Peter&quot; was to be called &quot;Professor Honeyman&quot; and I was a mere student. My bad.
That moment cut deeper than any poor grade could have. Here was someone who knew my Bell Labs experience, who understood the caliber of work expected there, dismissing my efforts as worthless. The sting wasn&#39;t just professional, it was personal. I thought our shared background would create connection; instead, it highlighted how far I still had to go.

you know there was a huge scandal at Boys Town involving sexual abuse of the boys.  The first time i read this I thought Dave had spent time there, and that something had happened to him.  Within the context of this story, though, it seems like more scae tactics from your mom.  Was your Dad on board with this emotional abuse?

another astute observation - but we haven't seen much of yu not being accepted, except briefly in elementary school. Forgive me if I'm projecting my own experience onto yours - but you are lighter than both your Mom and Dad - this never came up among your classmates? Among your friends?  Colorism ran rampant in my elementary school - it determined who I could and couldnt play with, played a factor in what fights I got into...nothing like that in Detroit?  Since race is going to play so heavily in the later chapter, a little foreshadowing here would be helpful

&quot;Dad, where are you going?&quot; my daughter Maya called behind me, her voice echoing through the stillness of Mom&#39;s empty house.
It had only been days since we buried her, and everything around us felt muted, like life had been padded in cotton. Maya, twenty now, and my son Jamil, eighteen, were helping my wife Gina sort through the carefully preserved pieces of our family&#39;s history: photo albums with brittle plastic pages, my baby book wrapped in orange wool, and boxes of loose photos that documented a lifetime I was struggling to believe had actually happened.

i know we always say begin with a scene, but in this case I think you're better off just being alone descending into that basement where so much of yur past is buried.  It metaphorically speaks to the journey you are about to take without getting into folks we don't know yet (Maya and Gina) - the first version you had - I think it was a year ago/ felt more lyrical

Just as I&#39;d learned to respect the distinct challenges of theoretical computer science rather than dismissing them, I was now learning to respect the unique dynamics of Gina&#39;s social circle rather than assuming I could instantly prove my worth through dramatic gestures.

Add Golden Guides! The Golden Guides were produced by Golden Press and became popular in the mid-20th century, especially in the 1950s and 1960s.

They were known for being both educational and accessible to children, with simple explanations and appealing artwork. If you were into learning about nature, science, or the world around you as a child, those books were a staple in many households and schools.

**Comment:**
Mom pursued the teaching career that Aunt Mae gave up, getting her Master of Education degree, specializing in teaching children with learning impairments. Wayne State was a natural choice—it was well-respected and had a strong commitment to education and social justice. But it wasn't just about education. The more qualifications she had, the more she could earn as a teacher in Detroit, and we needed that extra income. Dad worked hard, but Mom's salary started to outpace his once she had that master's degree and another 30 credit hours under her belt.

**Comment:**
Suggestions for further improvement:

Consider adding a brief reflection on how these experiences shaped your approach to education or your career choices later in life. This could provide a sense of how these childhood experiences influenced your adult self. For example:

"Years later, these experiences would shape my approach to education and my career choices. I found myself drawn to fields where intelligence was valued, yet always mindful of the delicate balance between standing out and fitting in."

You might consider expanding on the long-term impact of these experiences. For instance, after the sentence "The scars from those years would take a lifetime to heal," you could add:

"Even as an adult, I found myself hesitating before speaking up in meetings, the echo of childhood taunts still ringing in my ears. It took years of conscious effort to reclaim my voice and confidence."

Consider adding a brief moment of reflection on how these experiences might have shaped your empathy or understanding of others in similar situations. This could provide a sense of growth and perspective. For example:

"These painful years, while scarring, also instilled in me a deep empathy for outsiders and a determination to stand up against injustice. The boy who once wished for invisibility grew into a man who refused to let others suffer in silence."

You might consider adding a specific example of how the bullying affected your behavior or choices. For instance:

"I began to intentionally answer questions incorrectly in class, sacrificing my grades to avoid the sneers and threats that followed academic success. The joy I once found in learning was overshadowed by the need to survive."

Consider ending the section with a forward-looking statement that bridges your past experiences with your present perspective. For example:

"Looking back now, I realize that those years, as painful as they were, helped shape the person I am today. They taught me resilience, empathy, and the importance of standing up for what's right – lesson

**Comment:**
Based on the provided analysis, the sections of Derrick's memoir that would require the most significant revisions to meet Oprah's expectations for emotional depth and exploration are:
Experiences with Bullying: This section currently lacks insight into Derrick's emotional responses to the bullying he endured. Revising this section to include his feelings of fear, vulnerability, and the lasting impact of these encounters would add depth and resonate with Oprah's audience.
Loss of Aunt Mae: While Derrick acknowledges his grief, the narrative only briefly touches on the emotional impact of Aunt Mae's death. Expanding this section to explore the depth of his sadness, the ways he coped with her absence, and the lasting influence she had on his life would provide a more profound and moving narrative.
Struggles with Mental Health: This section currently provides a limited exploration of Derrick's experiences with depression and anxiety. Revising this section to delve deeper into these challenges, his coping mechanisms, and the overall impact on his well-being would offer a more comprehensive and relatable portrayal of his mental health journey.
While the other areas mentioned in the analysis could also benefit from additional emotional exploration, these three sections present the most significant opportunities for Derrick to enhance his memoir and create a more impactful and resonant narrative for Oprah and her audience.

Suggestions for Further Improvement:

Consider adding more specific details about your interactions at SGI. For example:

"At SGI, I found myself in an incredible work environment. I was surrounded by brilliant minds, including my advisors Tom and Rosemary, and my humble yet brilliant officemate, Vince. I remember one particularly intense brainstorming session where we all huddled around a whiteboard, furiously scribbling equations and diagrams as we tackled the NURBS problem. The energy in the room was electric, and I felt both intimidated and exhilarated to be part of such a dynamic team."

The section about Don Knuth's Concrete Mathematics class could be expanded to provide more insight into your learning experience:

"Don Knuth's Concrete Mathematics class was a revelation. As we delved into complex mathematical concepts, I found myself both challenged and inspired. One day, after a particularly enlightening lecture on generating functions, I approached Don with a question. His patient explanation not only clarified my confusion but also gave me a glimpse into the depth of his mathematical insight. It was moments like these that made me realize the true caliber of the minds I was surrounded by at Stanford."

Consider adding a brief reflection on how your experiences at Stanford compared to your expectations when you first arrived:

"As I reflected on my journey so far at Stanford, I realized how naive my initial expectations had been. I had arrived confident in my abilities, only to be humbled time and again by the sheer brilliance of my peers and professors. Yet, each setback was also a lesson, pushing me to redefine my goals and discover strengths I didn't know I possessed. Stanford was proving to be not just an academic challenge, but a profound journey of self-discovery."
These suggestions aim to add more personal details and reflections, further enhancing the emotional depth and relatability of your narrative. The improvements you've made have significantly strengthened your memoir, making it more engagi

**Comment:**
Suggestions to heighten emotional intensity while being loving and kind:

Acknowledge Gina's strength and resilience more explicitly. For example: "Gina, a pillar of strength, somehow managed to hold our family together despite my shortcomings. Her unwavering love and patience were a lifeline I often failed to grasp."
Include more specific moments of connection or attempts at connection, even if they fell short. This could show the desire to improve and be a better partner/father. For instance: "One evening, I mustered the courage to ask Gina how her day was, truly listening for the first time in weeks. Her surprise and cautious smile pierced my heart, a bittersweet reminder of how far I'd drifted."
Express more vulnerability about your feelings towards Gina. This could help readers (and potentially Gina) understand the depth of your struggle. For example: "As I watched Gina effortlessly comfort Jamil, a mix of awe and shame washed over me. I longed to be the partner she deserved, yet felt paralyzed by my own inadequacies."

The transition between the "First Contact" and "First Connection" sections feels a bit abrupt. Consider adding a bridging paragraph to smooth this transition.
The final paragraph about Phyllis's bequest feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the chapter. You might want to expand on this section or consider moving it to a later chapter if it fits better there.

**Comment:**
Suggestions for improvement:

Consider adding more sensory details to make the scenes more vivid, especially in the hospital settings.
The transition from the wedding to Thanksgiving feels a bit abrupt. Consider adding a connecting sentence or two to smooth this transition. Here are three alternatives:
a. "The joy of Maya's wedding faded all too quickly as the months passed, and Jala's health continued to decline."
b. "As summer turned to fall, our family's focus shifted from celebration to concern for Jala's deteriorating condition."
c. "The months following Maya's wedding were a rollercoaster of hope and worry as we watched Jala's health fluctuate."
The paragraph starting with "Jala and my daughter shared a similar trait" feels slightly out of place. Consider moving this observation to a more relevant part of the narrative or expanding on it to show its significance.
The conversation with Dr. Barber is crucial but feels a bit rushed. Consider expanding on this section to give more weight to Jala's spiritual journey and the comfort she found in his words.
The repeated use of "I got you" in the final moments is powerful, but consider varying the phrasing slightly to avoid overuse.

Areas for further improvement:

Characterization: While the content of Father Radloff's class is now more detailed, his character itself still remains somewhat underdeveloped. Consider adding a brief description of his appearance or mannerisms.
Dialogue: The section could still benefit from including some direct quotes or a brief exchange to bring Father Radloff's teaching style to life.
Emotional impact: While the intellectual impact of the class is now clearer, the emotional resonance could be strengthened. Consider describing how these discussions made you feel or how they changed your perspective on life.
Sensory details: The classroom setting and atmosphere during discussions are still not described, which could help immerse readers in the experience.

Suggestions for further improvement:

Add a brief physical description of Father Radloff or a characteristic gesture he often made while teaching.
Include a short snippet of dialogue, perhaps a question Father Radloff posed to the class or a memorable statement he made.
Describe your emotional reaction to one of the theories discussed in class, explaining how it challenged or confirmed your existing beliefs.
Paint a quick picture of the classroom setting or the atmosphere during a particularly engaging discussion.
Consider restructuring slightly to group similar ideas together. For example, you could move the paragraph about yearning for more than biblical stories earlier in the section to provide context for why you found the unique readings so engaging.

Overall, this updated version is a significant improvement, providing more depth and specific examples that give readers a clearer understanding of the class and its impact on you. With a few more tweaks to enhance characterization, dialogue, and sensory details, you'll have a very strong and engaging section of your memoir

Consider expanding on your parents' decision-making process regarding Dave's adoption. This could provide more insight into your family dynamics.
The transition from your Tae Kwon Do classes to the confrontation with the neighborhood boy feels abrupt. Consider adding a connecting sentence or two to smooth this transition. Here are three alternatives:
a. "Despite my newfound skills, I soon discovered that real-world confrontations were far more challenging than the controlled environment of the dojo."
b. "Eager to test my abilities, I didn't have to wait long before an opportunity presented itself in the form of a neighborhood bully."
c. "Little did I know that my martial arts training would be put to the test sooner than I expected, and in a way I hadn't anticipated."
The paragraph about the fight with Rosalind is powerful but could benefit from more sensory details to fully immerse the reader in the moment.
Consider elaborating on how your relationship with Dave evolved as you both grew older, to provide a more complete arc to your story.
The word "fear" is repeated frequently. While it's central to your experience, consider using synonyms or more specific descriptions in some instances to avoid repetition. Alternatives could include "dread," "apprehension," or "anxiety."

**Comment:**
Consider expanding on your initial experiences at Law Middle School. How did your interactions with teachers and students evolve over time? This could provide more depth to your experience of "anonymity."
The transition from your summer travels to the fall of 1975 could be smoother. Consider adding a connecting sentence. Here are three alternatives:
a. "As our family's summer adventures came to an end, I found myself facing a new journey of my own."
b. "The familiar rhythm of our summer travels gave way to an unexpected shift in my educational landscape."
c. "While our family traditions continued, my personal world was about to undergo a significant transformation."
The paragraph about the historical context of forced busing is informative but could be integrated more smoothly into your personal narrative. Consider weaving this information throughout the section rather than presenting it in one block.
The word "anonymity" is repeated in the title and the last paragraph. While it's clearly a key concept, consider using synonyms or related phrases in the body text, such as "invisibility," "blending in," or "lack of recognition."
The contrast between your expectations of a "race war" and the reality of your new school environment is powerful. Consider expanding on this further, perhaps by describing a specific interaction or observation that challenged your preconceptions.

The transition from the dish-washing anecdote to Dave's academic struggles is still a bit abrupt. Consider adding a transitional sentence to smooth this shift.
You might explore more deeply how your mother's different treatment of you and Dave affected your relationship with him during childhood. Did it create any tension or resentment?
The last sentence, "I interpreted the message to mean if I wanted love, then I needed to perform," is powerful. You might consider expanding on this realization and its long-term impact on you.

> At just 22, Marcia found herself in an unimaginable situation, one that tore her apart inside. She was the eldest daughter of Jewish immigrants, the pride and hope of her family, with a future that had always seemed bright and full of promise. But that future came crashing down when a divorce and an unplanned pregnancy upended everything she’d worked so hard to build. The father of her child was a Black law student at the University of Michigan, and deep down, she knew her family would never accept him.

**Comment:**
To enhance the emotional depth and flow of Chapter 2, consider these suggestions:

Expand on the Bond with David: Delve deeper into the unique connection the author formed with his brother David. Explore the shared experiences of being adopted, the comfort they found in each other's company, and how their bond helped them navigate the challenges of feeling like outsiders. This could include anecdotes about their shared activities, conversations, and the unspoken understanding they had as adopted siblings.
Explore the Challenges of Being Biracial: The author mentions feeling like an outsider due to his biracial identity. Expanding on this aspect could provide valuable insights into the complexities of navigating a world that often categorizes individuals based on race. This could involve sharing specific instances of microaggressions, stereotypes, or identity struggles the author faced, and how he coped with them.
Delve into the Mother's Strictness: The author describes his mother as a strict disciplinarian. Exploring the reasons behind her strictness, perhaps linking it to her experiences as a teacher or her upbringing, could add depth to her character and provide context for her parenting style. This could also lead to a discussion of the author's feelings about her strictness and how it impacted his relationship with her.
Enhance the Emotional Impact of Anecdotes: The chapter includes several anecdotes, such as the incident with Mrs. Blanding and the visits to Aunt Mae's house. Enhancing the emotional impact of these anecdotes could make them more engaging and relatable. This could involve focusing on the author's feelings during these experiences, using vivid language to describe his emotions, and highlighting the significance of these moments in shaping his resilience.
Transition Between Sections: The chapter transitions between different aspects of the author's life, such as his relationship with his brother, his mother's strictness, and his experiences at church. Smoother transitions between these sections

**Comment:**
This chapter sets the stage for the entire memoir and introduces the core theme of resilience. Expanding on the emotional complexities of adoption, the feelings of abandonment, and the yearning for identity would provide a deeper understanding of the author's early life experiences and their impact on his resilience.

However, there are a few areas where the emotional flow could be enhanced:

Deeper exploration of the author's emotions: While the opening anecdote hints at the author's confusion and questions about his adoption, delving deeper into his feelings of abandonment and yearning for identity could strengthen the emotional impact.
More focus on the mother's internal conflict: The narrative could further explore Marcia's internal conflict between her love for her child and her desire to provide a better life for him through adoption. This would add another layer of emotional depth to the story.
Transition to the author's adoptive parents: The abrupt shift from Marcia's story to the author's adoptive parents could be smoother. Perhaps a brief reflection on the author's feelings about his adoptive parents before introducing them could provide a more seamless transition.
