> During tax season, Dad&#39;s love of numbers became an act of service. He prepared tax returns for friends and neighbors, charging exactly $2, not because the work wasn&#39;t worth more, but because that small fee transformed help into a transaction, preserving everyone&#39;s dignity. Numbers were Dad&#39;s language of care.
To prepare, he brought home thick IRS guidebooks printed on cheap newsprint, studying every rule and regulation with the same precision he brought to TACOM payrolls. I devoured those guidebooks alongside him, absorbing my first lessons in accounting while watching Dad decode how the world worked. His excitement for the logic of numbers was infectious, each form was a puzzle to solve, each calculation a way to help someone keep more of what they&#39;d earned.

**Comment:**

**Quoted text:**
> Dad came alive at the bowling alley. The strikes and spares mattered, but what truly drew him in was the brotherhood, a place where he belonged completely. He threw himself into leadership roles with The National Bowling Association, an organization founded in 1939 Detroit as black bowlers sought to build their own community around the sport they loved.
Bowling was beautifully democratic, inexpensive enough that class barriers fell away on the lanes. By 1944, when the group became the National Bowling Association, Inc., Dad was part of something powerful. These men and women were creating their own space, their own traditions, launching the &quot;Equality in Bowling&quot; campaign that opened doors across the sport in 1950.
For Dad, those long evenings at the lanes meant finding his tribe, men who understood both the weight of responsibility and the sweet satisfaction of knocking down pins that had no choice but to fall.

**Comment:**
somehow this feels like it should be closer to that anecdote you tell about you and Dave dawdling about coming to the dinner table and your Mom's reaction...it informs your Dad's character and maybe your Mom's jealousy

The work demanded meticulous attention to detail and a strong grasp of financial systems, qualities Dad possessed in abundance.

**Comment:**
why did you procrastinate? you were that distrustful of the folx around you?    and allthis is unfolding while you're going back and forth to Michigan while you're trying to find your birth parents?  I'm wondering what would happen if you actually put the real story side by side instead of compartmentalizing them from each other.  get some index cards (or use Google Slides) and put the chapters about trying to find your birth parents against the chapters of your career, and see what happens... there may be some synchronicity

> Meeting Marcia didn&#39;t just answer questions about my origins; it revealed patterns I&#39;d inherited or adopted. Her intense need for belonging mirrored my own. Her explosive responses to exclusion echoed my own tendencies to withdraw or classify people as enemies. Most revealing was recognizing my pattern of pouring myself into obsessions - coding, searching for Burton, now Marcia - as a way to avoid family responsibilities and emotional complexity.

and yet you also grew up in this loving family.  genetics can play a role - up to a point.   Then environment takes over.

so how long is this after that initial effort to meet her?  Important to keep your readers in time...the actual dates mean less than the time elapsed....I had to go back and figure - so this is a week later.  You mention earlier that you were on the way to New York for the weekend, so this is a trip you made the following week?

the family relationships are getting complicated.  You could add "They had twin daughters, Karen's nieces, Angela and Jennifer." (any reaction to learning you had sisters in addition to a brother?  And any supposition of what a rewritten childhood might have looked like?)

you may have already searched there, but Harvard's university archives keep copies of the class reports - every 5-10 years we are asked to write what's happening in our lives.  Since your dad died so soon after graduation he may not have bothered to submit, but it may be worth a look, if you're still interested

**Comment:**
I think you mean "resulted in"? or were these laws passed secretly and they discovered them?  that seems strange...laws by nature require public input.  Maybe you mean regulations?  A bit of clarity here would help.  Maybe a chronological telling would help even more - I gather the letter from Detroit Probate court came after your own sleuthing efforts? But the way this is written it seems like she sent it out of nowhere and that motivated you to search more....

but you do mention her first in this chapter, and then drop her.  Generally, the characters we meet first in a story - or in a chapter - set the stage for what follows.  Here, you've done a bait and switch.

> As I struggled through that return swim, I confronted a metaphor for my larger life journey. I had always been swimming between worlds, between my biological heritage and my adoptive family, between Detroit&#39;s streets and elite academic institutions, between theory and practice. The difference now was that Gina and her circle represented a potential shore, a place where I might finally stop swimming and simply belong.

**Comment:**
did this really happen while you were trying not to drown or does it just seem fitting here?  something about it feels a bit cloying...you haven't mentioned this struggle with belonging before: in your adoptive family, it's been about love and having a brother; at Princeton, it's been more compartmentalization and what do I want to be...this is a nice metaphor but needs more of a set up. when last we left you you seemed perfectly happy in that seminar room with Knuth and at peace working with SGI

this chapter on the whole feels more disjointed than the previous ones.  You have a picture from your wedding, but no mention of it in the text.  The kids are suddenly here ... we need a little handholding through these events...

> A Moment in History
Two weeks later, Gina and I were curled up together on her living room couch, eyes fixed on the TV screen. Jesse Jackson had captured an astounding 29.7% of the Democratic nomination vote, a seismic shift in American political possibilities. His Rainbow Coalition had built bridges across racial and economic divides, challenging conventional wisdom about what kind of leadership Americans would accept.

For black professionals like Gina and me, watching from her living room in 1988, Jackson&#39;s campaign wasn&#39;t just politics, it was personal validation. Here was a man who refused to code-switch or dilute his blackness to appeal to white voters. In a nation still grappling with the legacies of Reagan-era policies that had devastated many black communities, Jackson&#39;s prominence offered a powerful counter-narrative about black leadership and possibility.

I glanced at Gina, recognizing my own complicated emotions mirrored in her eyes. Here we were, two black professionals n…

maybe you should just refer to her this way in the chapter on Princeton.  Using the name opens a whole other box of worms....plus if this gets published you would need to get her permission (as well as others you have mentioned here)...publishers have a whole raft of legal bs they put you through.  I understand that may be why you're just using first names.

Clearly, &quot;Peter&quot; was to be called &quot;Professor Honeyman&quot; and I was a mere student. My bad.
That moment cut deeper than any poor grade could have. Here was someone who knew my Bell Labs experience, who understood the caliber of work expected there, dismissing my efforts as worthless. The sting wasn&#39;t just professional, it was personal. I thought our shared background would create connection; instead, it highlighted how far I still had to go.

you know there was a huge scandal at Boys Town involving sexual abuse of the boys.  The first time i read this I thought Dave had spent time there, and that something had happened to him.  Within the context of this story, though, it seems like more scae tactics from your mom.  Was your Dad on board with this emotional abuse?

another astute observation - but we haven't seen much of yu not being accepted, except briefly in elementary school. Forgive me if I'm projecting my own experience onto yours - but you are lighter than both your Mom and Dad - this never came up among your classmates? Among your friends?  Colorism ran rampant in my elementary school - it determined who I could and couldnt play with, played a factor in what fights I got into...nothing like that in Detroit?  Since race is going to play so heavily in the later chapter, a little foreshadowing here would be helpful

&quot;Dad, where are you going?&quot; my daughter Maya called behind me, her voice echoing through the stillness of Mom&#39;s empty house.
It had only been days since we buried her, and everything around us felt muted, like life had been padded in cotton. Maya, twenty now, and my son Jamil, eighteen, were helping my wife Gina sort through the carefully preserved pieces of our family&#39;s history: photo albums with brittle plastic pages, my baby book wrapped in orange wool, and boxes of loose photos that documented a lifetime I was struggling to believe had actually happened.

i know we always say begin with a scene, but in this case I think you're better off just being alone descending into that basement where so much of yur past is buried.  It metaphorically speaks to the journey you are about to take without getting into folks we don't know yet (Maya and Gina) - the first version you had - I think it was a year ago/ felt more lyrical
