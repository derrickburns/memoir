> Chapter 1 - Momma’s Baby

**Comment:** This chapter sets the stage for the entire memoir and introduces the core theme of resilience. Expanding on the emotional complexities of adoption, the feelings of abandonment, and the yearning for identity would provide a deeper understanding of the author's early life experiences and their impact on his resilience.

However, there are a few areas where the emotional flow could be enhanced:

Deeper exploration of the author's emotions: While the opening anecdote hints at the author's confusion and questions about his adoption, delving deeper into his feelings of abandonment and yearning for identity could strengthen the emotional impact.
More focus on the mother's internal conflict: The narrative could further explore Marcia's internal conflict between her love for her child and her desire to provide a better life for him through adoption. This would add another layer of emotional depth to the story.
Transition to the author's adoptive parents: The abrupt shift from Marcia's story to the author's adoptive parents could be smoother. Perhaps a brief reflection on the author's feelings about his adoptive parents before introducing them could provide a more seamless transition.

> Adoptive Parents

**Comment:** Smooth out the transition from Marcia's story to Willa and Howard's. Consider adding a connecting sentence to bridge these narratives.
The paragraph about Howard's past could be tightened for clarity. Consider restructuring it to make the timeline of events clearer.
Explore Willa's fears about adopting a mixed-race child more deeply. This could provide an opportunity for greater emotional depth and character development.
Consider adding more sensory details to make the scenes more vivid and immersive.
The word "yearned" is used twice in close proximity. Consider using a synonym for one instance to avoid repetition.

**Comment:** Mom pursued the teaching career that Aunt Mae gave up, getting her Master of Education degree, specializing in teaching children with learning impairments. Wayne State was a natural choice—it was well-respected and had a strong commitment to education and social justice. But it wasn't just about education. The more qualifications she had, the more she could earn as a teacher in Detroit, and we needed that extra income. Dad worked hard, but Mom's salary started to outpace his once she had that master's degree and another 30 credit hours under her belt.

**Comment:** Consider expanding on your parents' decision-making process regarding Dave's adoption. This could provide more insight into your family dynamics.
The transition from your Tae Kwon Do classes to the confrontation with the neighborhood boy feels abrupt. Consider adding a connecting sentence or two to smooth this transition. Here are three alternatives:
a. "Despite my newfound skills, I soon discovered that real-world confrontations were far more challenging than the controlled environment of the dojo."
b. "Eager to test my abilities, I didn't have to wait long before an opportunity presented itself in the form of a neighborhood bully."
c. "Little did I know that my martial arts training would be put to the test sooner than I expected, and in a way I hadn't anticipated."
The paragraph about the fight with Rosalind is powerful but could benefit from more sensory details to fully immerse the reader in the moment.
Consider elaborating on how your relationship with Dave evolved as you both grew older, to provide a more complete arc to your story.
The word "fear" is repeated frequently. While it's central to your experience, consider using synonyms or more specific descriptions in some instances to avoid repetition. Alternatives could include "dread," "apprehension," or "anxiety."

> Oprah Criticisms

**Comment:** Based on the provided analysis, the sections of Derrick's memoir that would require the most significant revisions to meet Oprah's expectations for emotional depth and exploration are:
Experiences with Bullying: This section currently lacks insight into Derrick's emotional responses to the bullying he endured. Revising this section to include his feelings of fear, vulnerability, and the lasting impact of these encounters would add depth and resonate with Oprah's audience.
Loss of Aunt Mae: While Derrick acknowledges his grief, the narrative only briefly touches on the emotional impact of Aunt Mae's death. Expanding this section to explore the depth of his sadness, the ways he coped with her absence, and the lasting influence she had on his life would provide a more profound and moving narrative.
Struggles with Mental Health: This section currently provides a limited exploration of Derrick's experiences with depression and anxiety. Revising this section to delve deeper into these challenges, his coping mechanisms, and the overall impact on his well-being would offer a more comprehensive and relatable portrayal of his mental health journey.
While the other areas mentioned in the analysis could also benefit from additional emotional exploration, these three sections present the most significant opportunities for Derrick to enhance his memoir and create a more impactful and resonant narrative for Oprah and her audience.

> Moral Compass

**Comment:** Areas for further improvement:

Characterization: While the content of Father Radloff's class is now more detailed, his character itself still remains somewhat underdeveloped. Consider adding a brief description of his appearance or mannerisms.
Dialogue: The section could still benefit from including some direct quotes or a brief exchange to bring Father Radloff's teaching style to life.
Emotional impact: While the intellectual impact of the class is now clearer, the emotional resonance could be strengthened. Consider describing how these discussions made you feel or how they changed your perspective on life.
Sensory details: The classroom setting and atmosphere during discussions are still not described, which could help immerse readers in the experience.

Suggestions for further improvement:

Add a brief physical description of Father Radloff or a characteristic gesture he often made while teaching.
Include a short snippet of dialogue, perhaps a question Father Radloff posed to the class or a memorable statement he made.
Describe your emotional reaction to one of the theories discussed in class, explaining how it challenged or confirmed your existing beliefs.
Paint a quick picture of the classroom setting or the atmosphere during a particularly engaging discussion.
Consider restructuring slightly to group similar ideas together. For example, you could move the paragraph about yearning for more than biblical stories earlier in the section to provide context for why you found the unique readings so engaging.

Overall, this updated version is a significant improvement, providing more depth and specific examples that give readers a clearer understanding of the class and its impact on you. With a few more tweaks to enhance characterization, dialogue, and sensory details, you'll have a very strong and engaging section of your memoir

> Anonymity

**Comment:** Consider expanding on your initial experiences at Law Middle School. How did your interactions with teachers and students evolve over time? This could provide more depth to your experience of "anonymity."
The transition from your summer travels to the fall of 1975 could be smoother. Consider adding a connecting sentence. Here are three alternatives:
a. "As our family's summer adventures came to an end, I found myself facing a new journey of my own."
b. "The familiar rhythm of our summer travels gave way to an unexpected shift in my educational landscape."
c. "While our family traditions continued, my personal world was about to undergo a significant transformation."
The paragraph about the historical context of forced busing is informative but could be integrated more smoothly into your personal narrative. Consider weaving this information throughout the section rather than presenting it in one block.
The word "anonymity" is repeated in the title and the last paragraph. While it's clearly a key concept, consider using synonyms or related phrases in the body text, such as "invisibility," "blending in," or "lack of recognition."
The contrast between your expectations of a "race war" and the reality of your new school environment is powerful. Consider expanding on this further, perhaps by describing a specific interaction or observation that challenged your preconceptions.

> Chapter 2 - Finding Family

**Comment:** To enhance the emotional depth and flow of Chapter 2, consider these suggestions:

Expand on the Bond with David: Delve deeper into the unique connection the author formed with his brother David. Explore the shared experiences of being adopted, the comfort they found in each other's company, and how their bond helped them navigate the challenges of feeling like outsiders. This could include anecdotes about their shared activities, conversations, and the unspoken understanding they had as adopted siblings.
Explore the Challenges of Being Biracial: The author mentions feeling like an outsider due to his biracial identity. Expanding on this aspect could provide valuable insights into the complexities of navigating a world that often categorizes individuals based on race. This could involve sharing specific instances of microaggressions, stereotypes, or identity struggles the author faced, and how he coped with them.
Delve into the Mother's Strictness: The author describes his mother as a strict disciplinarian. Exploring the reasons behind her strictness, perhaps linking it to her experiences as a teacher or her upbringing, could add depth to her character and provide context for her parenting style. This could also lead to a discussion of the author's feelings about her strictness and how it impacted his relationship with her.
Enhance the Emotional Impact of Anecdotes: The chapter includes several anecdotes, such as the incident with Mrs. Blanding and the visits to Aunt Mae's house. Enhancing the emotional impact of these anecdotes could make them more engaging and relatable. This could involve focusing on the author's feelings during these experiences, using vivid language to describe his emotions, and highlighting the significance of these moments in shaping his resilience.
Transition Between Sections: The chapter transitions between different aspects of the author's life, such as his relationship with his brother, his mother's strictness, and his experiences at church. Smoother transitions between these sections

> Bullying

**Comment:** Suggestions for further improvement:

Consider adding a brief reflection on how these experiences shaped your approach to education or your career choices later in life. This could provide a sense of how these childhood experiences influenced your adult self. For example:

"Years later, these experiences would shape my approach to education and my career choices. I found myself drawn to fields where intelligence was valued, yet always mindful of the delicate balance between standing out and fitting in."

You might consider expanding on the long-term impact of these experiences. For instance, after the sentence "The scars from those years would take a lifetime to heal," you could add:

"Even as an adult, I found myself hesitating before speaking up in meetings, the echo of childhood taunts still ringing in my ears. It took years of conscious effort to reclaim my voice and confidence."

Consider adding a brief moment of reflection on how these experiences might have shaped your empathy or understanding of others in similar situations. This could provide a sense of growth and perspective. For example:

"These painful years, while scarring, also instilled in me a deep empathy for outsiders and a determination to stand up against injustice. The boy who once wished for invisibility grew into a man who refused to let others suffer in silence."

You might consider adding a specific example of how the bullying affected your behavior or choices. For instance:

"I began to intentionally answer questions incorrectly in class, sacrificing my grades to avoid the sneers and threats that followed academic success. The joy I once found in learning was overshadowed by the need to survive."

Consider ending the section with a forward-looking statement that bridges your past experiences with your present perspective. For example:

"Looking back now, I realize that those years, as painful as they were, helped shape the person I am today. They taught me resilience, empathy, and the importance of standing up for what's right – lesson

**✓ Derrick Burns** (2024-10-15)

> Chapter 11: Intellectual Pursuits and the Humbling Reality of Competition

**Comment:** Suggestions for Further Improvement:

Consider adding more specific details about your interactions at SGI. For example:

"At SGI, I found myself in an incredible work environment. I was surrounded by brilliant minds, including my advisors Tom and Rosemary, and my humble yet brilliant officemate, Vince. I remember one particularly intense brainstorming session where we all huddled around a whiteboard, furiously scribbling equations and diagrams as we tackled the NURBS problem. The energy in the room was electric, and I felt both intimidated and exhilarated to be part of such a dynamic team."

The section about Don Knuth's Concrete Mathematics class could be expanded to provide more insight into your learning experience:

"Don Knuth's Concrete Mathematics class was a revelation. As we delved into complex mathematical concepts, I found myself both challenged and inspired. One day, after a particularly enlightening lecture on generating functions, I approached Don with a question. His patient explanation not only clarified my confusion but also gave me a glimpse into the depth of his mathematical insight. It was moments like these that made me realize the true caliber of the minds I was surrounded by at Stanford."

Consider adding a brief reflection on how your experiences at Stanford compared to your expectations when you first arrived:

"As I reflected on my journey so far at Stanford, I realized how naive my initial expectations had been. I had arrived confident in my abilities, only to be humbled time and again by the sheer brilliance of my peers and professors. Yet, each setback was also a lesson, pushing me to redefine my goals and discover strengths I didn't know I possessed. Stanford was proving to be not just an academic challenge, but a profound journey of self-discovery."
These suggestions aim to add more personal details and reflections, further enhancing the emotional depth and relatability of your narrative. The improvements you've made have significantly strengthened your memoir, making it more engagi

**Comment:** I think you mean "resulted in"? or were these laws passed secretly and they discovered them?  that seems strange...laws by nature require public input.  Maybe you mean regulations?  A bit of clarity here would help.  Maybe a chronological telling would help even more - I gather the letter from Detroit Probate court came after your own sleuthing efforts? But the way this is written it seems like she sent it out of nowhere and that motivated you to search more....

Explore more deeply your feelings about being called "A-rab" and how this affected your sense of identity. This could be a powerful moment for reflection.
The transition from your personal experience to the broader demographic discussion could be smoother. Perhaps you could weave your personal observations throughout the demographic information to maintain a more consistent personal narrative.
Consider expanding on how the changing demographics affected the school culture or your personal experiences beyond just observing them.
You might want to provide more context about "The High" earlier in the section for readers who might not be familiar with the school.

You might want to explore your feelings about your birth mother more deeply. While you explain why you focused on your birth father, readers might be curious about your thoughts on your birth mother.
The transition between the "First Contact" and "First Connection" sections feels a bit abrupt. Consider adding a bridging paragraph to smooth this transition.
The final paragraph about Phyllis's bequest feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the chapter. You might want to expand on this section or consider moving it to a later chapter if it fits better there.
Look for opportunities to vary sentence structure, especially in longer paragraphs, to improve readability and maintain reader engagement.

**○ Derrick Burns** (2024-10-12)

> Lost in a Sea of Anxiety and Shame

**Comment:** Suggestions to heighten emotional intensity while being loving and kind:

Acknowledge Gina's strength and resilience more explicitly. For example: "Gina, a pillar of strength, somehow managed to hold our family together despite my shortcomings. Her unwavering love and patience were a lifeline I often failed to grasp."
Include more specific moments of connection or attempts at connection, even if they fell short. This could show the desire to improve and be a better partner/father. For instance: "One evening, I mustered the courage to ask Gina how her day was, truly listening for the first time in weeks.

**Comment:** Suggestions for further improvement:

Consider adding more sensory details to key scenes, like your first meeting with Marcia, to make them even more vivid.
The section about Burton and your new sisters feels slightly disconnected from the rest of the chapter. Consider adding a transitional paragraph to link it more closely to the themes of family and identity explored earlier.
You might want to expand on how your experiences with Marcia, Jala, and your new family members have shaped your understanding of "true power" and "embracing vulnerability" to tie back more explicitly to your hook.

**Comment:** you know there was a huge scandal at Boys Town involving sexual abuse of the boys.  The first time i read this I thought Dave had spent time there, and that something had happened to him.  Within the context of this story, though, it seems like more scae tactics from your mom.  Was your Dad on board with this emotional abuse?

**Comment:** if you were trying to read her mood, it tells me that this wasn't the first time she had snapped.  there's an element of you walking on eggshells around her that you haven't explicated yet...  and why would she take you to the bowling alley because you dawdled about coming to dinner/.

> Chapter 24: Jala’s Final Year

**Comment:** Suggestions for improvement:

Consider adding more sensory details to make the scenes more vivid, especially in the hospital settings.
The transition from the wedding to Thanksgiving feels a bit abrupt. Consider adding a connecting sentence or two to smooth this transition. Here are three alternatives:
a. "The joy of Maya's wedding faded all too quickly as the months passed, and Jala's health continued to decline."
b. "As summer turned to fall, our family's focus shifted from celebration to concern for Jala's deteriorating condition."
c. "The months following Maya's wedding were a rollercoaster of hope and worry as we watched Jala's health fluctuate."
The paragraph starting with "Jala and my daughter shared a similar trait" feels slightly out of place. Consider moving this observation to a more relevant part of the narrative or expanding on it to show its significance.
The conversation with Dr. Barber is crucial but feels a bit rushed. Consider expanding on this section to give more weight to Jala's spiritual journey and the comfort she found in his words.
The repeated use of "I got you" in the final moments is powerful, but consider varying the phrasing slightly to avoid overuse.

**Comment:** Suggestions for further improvement:

Consider adding a brief reflection on how your experiences with diverse interns and colleagues specifically challenged or expanded your understanding of race and identity.
You might want to elaborate slightly on how the tragic news from home affected your summer experience and your perspective on leaving for college.
The transition between the nightclub experience and the NTA conference could be smoothed out a bit more to show how these diverse experiences contributed to your growth.

**Comment:** this is the kind of note that drives writers crazy: I'm assuming this is shorthand for "Sugar" but it stopped me when I read it in the Substack... cause I was wondering how many names your had....I think you culd be a bit more explicit about these lessons from Aunt Mae. Older you can enter the narrative more forcefully here, looking back on the meaning of these anecdotes.
