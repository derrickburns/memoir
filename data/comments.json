He prepared tax returns for friends and neighbors, charging exactly $2, not because the work wasn&#39;t worth more, but because that small fee transformed help into a transaction, preserving everyone&#39;s dignity. Numbers were Dad&#39;s language of care.\nTo prepare, he brought home thick IRS guidebooks printed on cheap newsprint, studying every rule and regulation with the same precision he brought to TACOM payrolls. I devoured those guidebooks alongside him, absorbing my first lessons in accounting while watching Dad decode how the world worked. His excitement for the logic of numbers was infectious, each form was a puzzle to solve, each calculation a way to help someone keep more of what they&#39;d earned.",

He threw himself into leadership roles with The National Bowling Association, an organization founded in 1939 Detroit as black bowlers sought to build their own community around the sport they loved.\nBowling was beautifully democratic, inexpensive enough that class barriers fell away on the lanes. By 1944, when the group became the National Bowling Association, Inc., Dad was part of something powerful. These men and women were creating their own space, their own traditions, launching the &quot;Equality in Bowling&quot; campaign that opened doors across the sport in 1950.\nFor Dad, those long evenings at the lanes meant finding his tribe, men who understood both the weight of responsibility and the sweet satisfaction of knocking down pins that had no choice but to fall.",
