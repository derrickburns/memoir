Chapter 14: Encountering Love

While I had finally found clarity about my professional identity, my personal life remained adrift. The questions of belonging that had followed me from Detroit to Princeton now echoed through Stanford's halls. I had learned to navigate between worlds professionally, theory and practice, academia and industry, but meaningful human connection seemed perpetually out of reach. Each phone call to my Princeton girlfriend grew more distant as we silently acknowledged we were evolving along different paths.



Getting a PhD in two years was a bold ambition, and sixteen months into my Stanford journey, reality had set in, I was nowhere close. Weekends brought some relief, largely thanks to James, who introduced me to his circle of Cal friends. Casual poker games and outings to Silks nightclub in Emeryville provided welcome distractions. Yet despite this camaraderie, a profound loneliness lingered; I craved emotional connection.



When BellCore offered a summer placement back East, I eagerly accepted, not just for professional growth, but for a chance to reconnect with my Princeton network. This included a former girlfriend from Fort Lauderdale who'd moved to New York after graduation. Her suggestion to meet one April night in midtown Manhattan in 1988 felt like an opportunity for closure, or perhaps something more.



By 10:30 PM, my second Long Island Iced Tea was gone. She wasn't coming. The bartender's sympathetic glance, that universal look reserved for the stood-up, said everything as I signaled for another drink. April 1st. The calendar mocked me as I sat nursing wounded pride in a bar full of strangers.



Three drinks in two hours was too much, so I cancelled my request, paid my check, and headed out. Embarrassed and frustrated, I donned my prized light gray distressed leather bomber jacket, flipped up its stand-up collar, and headed to the Village Gate in Greenwich Village to join Patrick and other Princeton friends.

The Meeting

"Point out the finest woman here," I challenged Keith, my pride still bruised from earlier rejection.



Keith scanned deliberately before nodding toward the bar. 



"Her, the one in the black leather mini, talking to Vietta."



I followed his gaze and recognized Vietta Johnson from Princeton, now a Harvard-trained orthopedist. Beside her stood a striking woman with commanding posture, long brown hair shimmering under the club lights.



"You know my cousin Vietta?" Keith asked.



"Oh yes," I confirmed, ready to make a bee line over to meet her gorgeous friend.



Drawing on years of sister-cousin coaching, I crossed the dance floor. I fought to maintain eye contact and not glance down at that leather mini again. Her eyes locked onto mine with a slight, warm, welcoming smile. Up close, she was even more captivating, her intelligent eyes immediately sizing me up.



"Gina," Vietta introduced, "this is Derrick, a Princeton classmate. Derrick, meet Gina, a fellow resident at St. Vincent's."



"Resident?" I extended my hand. Her grip was firm, confident.



"Medical resident," she smiled slightly. "Third-year internal medicine."



As Vietta introduced us, something shifted in the atmosphere, an instant recognition that transcended the club's superficial environment. When Gina's eyes met mine, I felt simultaneously exposed and welcomed, as if she could see past my carefully constructed personas to something more authentic beneath. The sensation was both terrifying and exhilarating, like stepping onto solid ground after months at sea.



We talked as we danced, voices competing with music, her sophisticated perfume lingering in my senses. Hours dissolved into minutes.



As closing time approached, I asked the question I had forced myself to hold back until it was welcome.



"What is your phone number?" I asked with the confidence of a male lion.



She raised an eyebrow playfully.



"Want to write it down?"



"No need. I got it." 



My bravado masked frantic mental repetition, 212-515-0472, 212-515-0472.



Her skeptical expression told me she didn't expect I'd remember. Neither of us knew this chance encounter, sparked by a stood-up date, would reshape our lives.

The Chase

Six weeks after our first meeting, I clutched my BellCore summer offer letter with mixed emotions. It was now early June 1988, and my $770 weekly salary hinged on passing qualifying exams I hadn't yet taken. But Doctor Chung had made an exception, giving me just enough breathing room for what mattered most: pursuing Gina.



Our first date almost ended before it began. I paced anxiously in Saint Vincent's Hospital lobby, shoes squeaking against polished floors, checking my watch repeatedly. Forty-five minutes late. The emergency room guard's glances grew from polite to sympathetic. Just as I prepared to leave, Gina strode in, smiling and joyful.



"I just got your page," she said happily. "Have you been waiting long?"



"I have been here for 45 minutes," I blurted, barely hiding my feeling of contempt.



"Let's go to a local spot," she led. 



As I followed her out of the hospital, the unfamiliar neighborhood streets compounded my lingering anxiety.



After fifty steps, Gina broke the awkward silence.

 

"So, what exactly do you do at Stanford? Computer engineering?"



"Computer science," I corrected, defensively adding, 



"I think for a living."



She raised an eyebrow and turned toward Manhattan's passing lights, unimpressed.



Great start, Derrick, I chided myself.



Yet, something softened between us as we walked after dinner, the city lights illuminating our conversation.



"Are you familiar with New York? I grew up near City College," she said, gesturing north. 



"I live with my father in our co-op near 141st Street."



"Harlem?"



"Yes, Harlem," she said firmly. "Before gentrification became trendy, before Columbia swallowed everything around it."



"And you went to...?"



"Fieldston, then Yale, then Howard for medical school." She listed her credentials matter-of-factly.



Her connection to Howard resonated powerfully, highlighting my Stanford isolation, echoing my yearning for community. Her world felt both larger and more grounded than mine, intimidating yet irresistible.



My Princeton network stretched across the East Coast like an invisible safety net. These weren't just casual acquaintances but links in a carefully cultivated chain of black excellence, graduates who had emerged from the pressure cooker of elite education with their identities intact. When Vietta introduced me to Gina, she wasn't just connecting two individuals but potentially extending this precious network.

Testing Waters

On our second date at Melvin's apartment in Morristown, New Jersey, I prepared an ambitious chicken Alfredo while we watched a rented VHS.



As Gina shared the realities of her thirty-hour hospital shifts and life-or-death decisions, my own professional challenges at Stanford acquired new perspective. My theoretical computer science struggles suddenly seemed contained in a protected bubble, far removed from the raw human suffering Gina encountered daily. Yet I recognized a surprising parallel: we were both fundamentally problem-solvers, though in vastly different domains.



Despite the gravity of our conversation, or perhaps because of it, I decided it was time for a strategic move. Heart racing with anticipation, I suddenly sprinted upstairs, returning moments later in a carefully selected tank top and matching shorts, not so subtly highlighting months of hard-earned muscle. Throwing in a casual flex, I basked briefly in my moment, though her reaction was harder to read than I'd hoped.



At 1 AM, when Gina announced she was ready to head home, another assumption shattered. The fifty-mile drive to Manhattan, followed by the lonely fifty-mile return to New Jersey, gave me ample time to reflect.



On our third date, Gina's pager went off twice during dinner. She excused herself each time, returning with the weary resignation I would come to recognize as part of her professional armor.



"It's one of my patients," she said softly after the second interruption. 



"Thirty-two-year-old with PCP pneumonia. Fourth hospitalization this year."



Gina's casual mention of "PCP pneumonia" told me everything about the medical world she inhabited in 1988. Her 32-year-old patient was almost certainly dying of AIDS, a disease that medicine was still struggling to comprehend. When she returned to the table, the weariness in her eyes spoke of medicine's limitations in the face of this epidemic. While I wrote code in comfortable labs, Gina worked on the frontlines of a crisis that disproportionately affected marginalized communities.



Gina possessed a centered calm that both attracted and perplexed me. While I had spent my life shape-shifting to fit different environments, she moved through the world with a consistent core identity. Watching her switch effortlessly between technical medical terminology and compassionate inquiries about family members, I recognized this wasn't compartmentalization as I'd practiced it, this was integration, a wholeness I was still learning to achieve.

A Moment in History

Two weeks later, Gina and I were curled up together on her living room couch, eyes fixed on the TV screen. Jesse Jackson had captured an astounding 29.7% of the Democratic nomination vote, a seismic shift in American political possibilities. His Rainbow Coalition had built bridges across racial and economic divides, challenging conventional wisdom about what kind of leadership Americans would accept.



For black professionals like Gina and me, watching from her living room in 1988, Jackson's campaign wasn't just politics, it was personal validation. Here was a man who refused to code-switch or dilute his blackness to appeal to white voters. In a nation still grappling with the legacies of Reagan-era policies that had devastated many black communities, Jackson's prominence offered a powerful counter-narrative about black leadership and possibility.



I glanced at Gina, recognizing my own complicated emotions mirrored in her eyes. Here we were, two black professionals navigating elite spaces, witnessing something extraordinary unfold. The scale of what Jackson had achieved, taking his rightful place on the national stage, unapologetically black, resonated strongly with our own journeys through predominantly white institutions where we constantly negotiated our identities.

The Caribbean Test

Over our first weeks together, I'd noticed something wonderfully authentic in Gina's friendships: genuine warmth, deep trust, and the kind of meaningful connections I'd always valued.



When she called that Friday, casually mentioning, "My brother Hugh is organizing a sailing trip in the Caribbean to celebrate the end of my residency," I listened carefully for what wasn't being said.



"I don't know if there's room," she added lightly, "but if there is… would you like to come?"



This wasn't just a vacation invitation, it was an offer to step into the inner circle of her life, to meet the people who knew her longest and loved her most. For someone who had spent a lifetime trying to prove I belonged, this invitation represented something precious and precarious.



The hesitation in her voice wasn't about physical space, it was about inviting me deeper into her world, into friendships built on honesty and permanence. This wasn't a casual offer; it was a quiet test, an invitation into her future.



When I shared my dilemma with Mom, that I'd already committed to Miche's brother's wedding, her response was swift: "Weddings are a dime a dozen. Go sailing in the Caribbean!"



Mom's immediate counsel revealed something essential about her character that I was only beginning to fully appreciate. Beneath her strict rules and high expectations had always run a pragmatic understanding of human connection. She recognized that genuine bonds of love and friendship were ultimately more precious than any achievement.



She was right. Weddings were common enough, but a chance like this, an invitation into Gina's carefully nurtured circle, felt rare and significant.

Testing Waters (Literally)

I stood on the deck of the sailboat, watching the turquoise waves lap gently against the hull. The sleek Sou'wester 51 CC was our home for the week. Hugh, Gina's older brother and a successful attorney, and his wife, RuthAnne, had quickly put me at ease with their humor, reminiscent of the playful teasing between my mother and Uncle Bubba.



Hugh embodied a different kind of male excellence than I'd encountered in academia or Silicon Valley. His confidence wasn't wrapped in credentials or technical jargon but in an easy authenticity and clear sense of purpose. In him, I glimpsed what brotherhood could look like when untangled from the complexities of adoption and difference that had shaped my relationship with Dave.



Still, beneath my laughter, I felt the pressure of approval, eager to impress, yet wary of stumbling. My heart quickened when Hugh casually mentioned swimming to shore. From the deck, that beach appeared close enough, maybe 200 yards, tops. Confident after seeing Hugh's swimming skills earlier, I decided to slip quietly into the water, leaving Jay's recommended life vest behind.



The initial swim felt manageable, but upon reaching shore and turning back, the boat suddenly looked shockingly distant. I scanned the water for Hugh, only then realizing he hadn't followed. He had probably joked about swimming to shore and gone below deck with everyone else.



The return swim turned treacherous. Each stroke became increasingly difficult as fatigue set in. By the time I hauled myself up onto the deck, my arms and shoulders were burning intensely, and my breathing ragged. Our party below remained completely oblivious to my absence.



As I struggled through that return swim, I confronted a metaphor for my larger life journey. I had always been swimming between worlds, between my biological heritage and my adoptive family, between Detroit's streets and elite academic institutions, between theory and practice. The difference now was that Gina and her circle represented a potential shore, a place where I might finally stop swimming and simply belong.



Later that evening, when I casually mentioned my adventure to Hugh, his expression shifted from surprise to what seemed like newfound respect. "Man, that's a serious swim," he said, clapping my shoulder. "Next time, tell someone before you go." His concern, wrapped in casual brotherhood, felt like acceptance.

Leap of Faith

Back in New York, reality quickly overshadowed our Caribbean afterglow. One evening, as Gina entered the front door of her co-op apartment building on Convent Avenue, a thief snatched the gold chain from her neck. The incident unsettled her far beyond the loss of jewelry. For a woman who'd confidently navigated New York streets all her life, this violation fractured something fundamental in her relationship with the city.



"When are you coming to California?" I asked over the phone, only half-joking.



Gina and I had casually discussed her moving to California, but I'd never taken it seriously. New Yorkers don't leave New York, especially not Harlem-raised, Yale-educated doctors whose East Coast roots stretch back generations.



Yet after the mugging, subtle shifts became noticeable. She didn't break down or blame the city outright; that wasn't her style. In the following weeks, our conversations about the future changed. She stopped automatically dismissing California, instead asking thoughtful questions about neighborhoods, hospitals, and lifestyle. I could sense the careful calculation happening behind her eyes, the measured assessment of a physician reevaluating her prognosis.



Then one Tuesday night, she called and said simply, "I'm looking at positions in Northern California."



No dramatic announcement, no emotional declaration, just a quiet certainty. Gina never wavered once her mind was set. As I struggled to find words, I wondered: Had the mugging truly changed her, or had I underestimated how deeply she valued our relationship all along?



When Gina announced she was looking at positions in Northern California, I felt a dizzying mixture of elation and terror. Her words represented a profound act of faith, not just in our relationship, but in me. This brilliant woman with deep East Coast roots was willing to uproot her life based on a connection we'd built over just months. Was I worthy of such faith?



Meanwhile, Stanford beckoned me back with its own urgency, qualifying exams, research deadlines, the relentless march toward my PhD. Our discussions began circling an impossible question: How do you merge two lives on opposite coasts?



My academic pivot from theory to systems found unexpected echoes in my evolving relationship with Gina. Just as I'd discovered that my true contribution lay not in pure theory but in bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementation, I was learning that real intimacy required bridging the gap between idealized romance and practical partnership. Both transitions demanded authenticity over performance, substance over appearance.



The answer emerged unexpectedly. When Gina mentioned practicing medicine in California, the Palo Alto Medical Clinic initially seemed perfect, until suddenly, inexplicably, the offer was rescinded. But Gina, driven by the same resolve that had carried her through medical residency, secured a position at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco instead. With the decision now firm and the employment path clear, we transformed a bi-coastal dating relationship into a budding new future together.
