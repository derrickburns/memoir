Chapter 8: Finding My Voice

When the yellow bus turned east onto Seven Mile Road, we passed familiar landmarks that now felt different - Mac's Barber Shop where I got my haircut once a month, the Mount Elliott Post Office that Mom and Dad occasionally visited on weekends, Mound Road where Dad worked just a few miles north. Then we entered unfamiliar territory, crossing Sherwood Street past the familiar K-mart and turning left onto Rogge Street. Houses on Rogge looked similar to Mr. Harvell's house next door and Mrs. Dukes' house across the street, both two stories with large porches, older than ours, but with nice lawns like Mr. Allen's.

Law Middle School loomed ahead - three stories of red brick with wide concrete steps leading to heavy wooden doors with brass handles. As I stepped off the bus, that's when I saw them - white kids. Not just one or two, but dozens of them, streaming through those brass-handled doors. I recalled the talk about "the white boys coming" to Atkinson.

My footsteps echoed in the empty hallway, which smelled of floor wax and new textbooks. White kids clustered by their lockers, black kids found each other, and teachers watched carefully from doorways. 

The white kids didn't really notice me. They were too busy with their own friend drama to care about me one way or another. At first, I thought they were ignoring me, but then I realized - for the first time in my life, I did not stand out. Nobody cared that my hair was straight, that my skin was light, or that I was adopted. I was anonymous, and that was just fine!

Miss Vigliotti looked like the pretty white women I saw on TV shows - the ones who played doctors' wives or teachers in those after-school specials. She had this really nice smile and always made me feel smart when I got the right answer. When she wrote 'Excellent work!' on my paper, I kept that assignment in my folder long after we'd moved on to new chapters. Sometimes I'd raise my hand even when I wasn't completely sure of the answer, just to see her smile when she called my name. When she announced that she would be taking a leave for a year, I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. Math wasn't as fun after she left.

Then came the fine arts class in the auditorium. That year, girls suddenly seemed different. When the teacher paired us up for square dancing, my heart nearly stopped. Kim stood across from me, her strawberry blonde hair catching the light, blue eyes darting away when I looked at her. Her hands felt cool and dry against mine as we learned to dance. Every time we had to do-si-do or promenade, our hands would touch and my heart would beat really fast.

"Bow to your partner!" the teacher called over the scratchy country music. I counted under my breath, trying not to step on her feet, trying not to notice how she smelled like flowers, trying to ignore how my heart raced every time we touched.

After class, I gathered my courage in the hallway. Lockers slammed around us as kids rushed to their next class.

"Hey Kim..."

"Yeah?" She shifted her weight between feet.

"Can I have your number?"

"No!"

Her answer came quiet but firm, eyes fixed on the floor. I watched Kim hurry away down the hall, my stomach tight.

I kept replaying that "No" in my head during classes, wondering what it was about me she'd rejected so quickly. The worst part wasn't even the rejection - it was seeing her every day, pretending nothing had happened, while my stomach did flip-flops whenever she walked by. That "No" followed me to every class, making me question what else about me people might reject.

Then came Doctor James Allen Jones, my first black male teacher. Like my Dad, he always wore a sports coat and slacks to work. He was bald with a neat beard and mustache, and wore dark rectangular glasses. Doctor Jones commanded the classroom like Doctor Morton commanded the pulpit. Confident, certain of his role, adroit in his navigation of territory that he most certainly controlled: Shakespeare for one, the Bible for the other, each offering insights into human behavior, human morals, and human foibles.

Watching Doctor Jones move across that classroom, I realized I was witnessing something I'd seen before but never quite understood, the way certain Black men could own any space they entered, not by diminishing themselves but by fully inhabiting their authority. Doctor Morton had taught me that excellence could be spiritual; Doctor Jones was showing me it could be intellectual.

Maps covered the classroom walls - not just the usual pull-down kind, but detailed maps showing mountains, rivers, and cities from around the world. But Doctor Jones really came alive when he announced tryouts for the school play, performing lines from Macbeth:

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

His voice filled the classroom, making Shakespeare's words sound like music. Watching him command that room, I wanted his confidence, his swagger. I wanted to own my space the way he owned his.

When he announced tryouts for the school play, I signed up right away. I wasn't nervous about performing - I'd been an altar boy at church and had lead roles in several church youth performances, including a Tom Thumb wedding. The auditorium smelled like dust and old velvet curtains, with rows of empty seats stretching back into darkness. A single spotlight lit the stage where Doctor Jones stood, his voice echoing off the walls as he explained the audition process.

That's how I met Eugene. Eugene strode onto stage like he owned it. His deep voice filled the space as Shakespeare's words flowed naturally from him. I watched in awe. He was in seventh grade, a year ahead of me, and the only other black kid trying out.

We were the only two black people in the play, the only two black boys. Theater forces interaction in much the same way that square dancing in class does. The engagement is structured, choreographed. But there is room for interpretation, for expression. I was in awe of Eugene's presence. He spoke with such conviction.

After rehearsal one day, Eugene caught up with me. He didn't take my bus to school, so I asked him where he lived.

"Albany, just one street west of Mound Road," he said.

"Want to come over?" he asked.

"Yes," I answered excitedly.

Mom let me ride my 1970 Campus Green Schwinn Sting-Ray the one mile east on Stockton to his house, my longest trip ever. I rode quickly past the Sojourner Truth projects, past the park where Bernie had taught me to play chess, past Atkinson Elementary School where I had been teased and bullied. Anxiety turned into excitement as I reached the streets beyond Atkinson and turned right onto Albany to Eugene's house.

He introduced me to his mom and sister.

"You play chess?"

"Yeah, I'm pretty good," I said, thinking about my games with Bernie at the park, but quickly regretting my boast as I remembered losing the 10 and under division of the City of Detroit Chess Tournament the year before.

"Want to play?"

What had started as survival at Law, learning to speak up in integrated classrooms, was evolving into something I'd never expected: the desire to be heard, to lead, to create the very spaces where voices like mine could thrive. Doctor Jones had shown me that commanding attention wasn't about fitting in, it was about refusing to diminish yourself.

That weekend, funk music played softly in Eugene's family room while sunlight filtered through curtains. I had ridden my green bike the one mile east to his house on Albany Street. It was a small room, but comfortable. Through the doorway to the kitchen, I could see family photos attached with magnets on the refrigerator, and the smell of dinner cooking made my stomach growl. The chess pieces felt smooth and heavy as we set up the board on the table between us.

I thought I was good at chess until I played Eugene. Ten moves later, he knocked over my king with his queen.

"Checkmate!"

"One more game?"

"Want another ass whoopin'?" he laughed.

"Bring it" I said, bluffing a confidence that I did not have.

After my second loss, Eugene needled me "I thought you said you were good!"

"I have to go home. You won't be so lucky next time" I offered.

As I rode my bike home, I thought about the chess matches and I realized that I was smiling. Usually, I hated losing, but Eugene was different. He was smart like me but didn't try to hide it. He was cool too - the other kids respected him. And now he was my friend!

Eugene got the main part in the play - Caius Martius in "Coriolanus." I got the part of First Citizen. That meant I was just one of the people in the crowd, but I was determined to be the best crowd person ever.

Then one late afternoon, as the clock ticked toward dismissal and chalk dust floated in the air, Doctor Jones paused dramatically. "I will be taking a select group of students to perform Coriolanus in England this summer. Here is a flyer. Take it to your parents if you are interested. Rehearsals start next week."

The classroom erupted in excited whispers. England! I couldn't believe it. That was a place in books and movies, not somewhere real people like me actually went. When I asked my parents about it, I was sure they'd say no. It cost $700, and Mom had already said no when David Ragland invited me to go skiing with him for $100. But they surprised me and said yes!

But first, I needed a passport. David Knott's mom provided us with passport applications. David had a big part in the play. Mrs. Knott would join the trip as a chaperone. I would go alone.

We met at the Mount Elliott Post Office on Saturday with passport photo, completed application, birth certificate, and fee in hand. When I slid my birth certificate across the counter, the clerk frowned.

"This copy is dated over a year after your birth," he said loudly, like he wanted everyone to hear.

My face got hot. I leaned in close to whisper "I was adopted."

Everyone in line could hear, and they all started looking at me. I wanted to disappear. I stared at the date on my birth certificate, the numbers swimming before my eyes. Everyone else in line probably had normal birth certificates, ones that matched their birthdays exactly. My stomach churned as I wondered how many other papers in our house told different stories about who I was. Standing there, I realized how many everyday moments could suddenly become explanations about who I was and why my story was different.

The clerk said that he could not accept that document, and suggested that I return with my parents, but I could barely hear him over the rushing sound in my ears.

When I got home, I told Mom what happened. She just said calmly that she'd take care of it, but I could tell this was going to lead to conversations I wasn't sure I wanted to have.

Two weeks later, Mom handed me my new passport with a quiet smile that said she'd handled everything, just like she always did. The crisp blue booklet felt heavier than it should have, each page a promise of places I'd only seen in Doctor Jones's classroom maps.

"Thank you, Mom," I said, running my thumb across the gold embossed eagle on the cover.

Mom laid out my suitcase on the bed and proceeded to pack for me.

"Derrick, grab a belt and 4 pairs of pants from the closet," she ordered.

"After you brush your teeth tonight, place your toothbrush in this container and put it in this toiletry bag."

The plane engine hummed as we took off into the evening sky. Through my small oval window, I watched Detroit's lights spread out below - the Ambassador Bridge glowing like a string of pearls, Windsor fading into darkness until clouds swallowed everything. My stomach felt weird during takeoff, and I squeezed my eyes shut until we were in the air. This wasn't like the short trips I'd taken with Mom and Dad - I was crossing an ocean, and I was on my own.

I woke up to a gray Scottish dawn in Glasgow. Everything sounded different - even the airport announcements were in strange accents. The air smelled different too, like coal fires and something else I couldn't name. When the immigration officer stamped my passport, it felt real for the first time - I was actually in another country.

Everything here was backwards. Cars drove on the wrong side of the road. The British pound didn't weigh a pound, but was worth almost 2 US dollars. Even breakfast was weird - beans on toast? The train to the Lake District clicked and clacked along the tracks, while green hills rolled past the rain-streaked windows. Stone walls crisscrossed the fields like a giant's game of tic-tac-toe, and sheep dotted the hillsides like tiny cotton balls.

Our bed-and-breakfast was this old three-story house with creaky stairs and tiny rooms. But it had something amazing - a TV game called Pong! You could actually move the lines on the screen with these knobs and play tennis! I'd never seen anything like it. I played only once, saving my money for souvenirs to take back.

Mom had asked me to bring her something special. I didn't know what Wedgwood was, but Mrs. Knott said that she would take me to get some. "How about this one?" she pointed to a plate with an image of Benjamin Franklin in raised relief on it. "It's for America's two-hundredth birthday," the sales clerk explained. I counted my money carefully and bought two plates. The lady wrapped them up in so much paper, I was sure they wouldn't break.

Our first performance came too quickly, an open-air performance in the park, a warm-up to the "real" performance in a local children's hospital. With a smaller travel troupe than we had back home, I was assigned additional small roles. Now I was Citizens One, Two, and Three.

As we set up in the hospital cafeteria, I surveyed the room. The English kids came in, some in wheelchairs, some on crutches, and some pulling IV stands. For the first time, I was nervous. I didn't want to disappoint these kids. They weren't our parents who had to applaud. They were sick and needed something from us.

But then I heard my first line come out strong and clear, just like we'd practiced. No one coughed or shuffled or whispered. When I finished my last line, a nurse in the front row smiled and nodded, like I'd done something special. When we took our final bow, the applause thundered. Stoic but back erect, Doctor Jones thanked the crowd for their kind approval.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I'd given something meaningful to people who really needed it. This wasn't about grades or approval or fitting in - this was about using what I could do to make sick children forget their pain for an hour. The feeling was intoxicating.

But as the performance ended and we mingled with the audience, I spotted Eugene across the dining room, laughing with some kids from the play. When I waved, he just nodded and turned away. My chest felt tight. What happened to our chess games, our talks? The dining room suddenly felt too hot, too crowded.

Back home, Eugene and I would have been playing chess right about now, arguing about moves and laughing. But something had shifted during the trip. Maybe it was watching him command the stage as Coriolanus, or the way the other kids looked up to him. Maybe I reminded him of a version of himself he was trying to leave behind. Either way, he acted like those games never happened.

As the room closed in on me, I headed outside. The English evening was cool and damp, nothing like Detroit summers. As I walked away, Eugene held court.I felt small and left out, like the kid who always finished his work first but had no one to share it with.

When we arrived back at the bed-and-breakfast, I ran down the garden path, stone walls on either side and flower beds buzzing with bees, when suddenly - sharp, hot pain! Before I could stop myself, tears welled up. I ran to Mrs. Knott, pointing to the site of the sting, thankful that all the other kids were off playing elsewhere. I was eleven years old - too old to be seen crying over a stupid bee sting!

But it wasn't really about the bee sting. It was about Eugene, about feeling alone even when surrounded by people, about not knowing how to keep the friendships I thought I'd made. Was Eugene really my friend?

The flight home felt different than the trip over. I stared out the window as England disappeared below the clouds, then hours of ocean, then finally the familiar lights of Detroit spreading out like a circuit board. Everything looked smaller than I remembered.

When we got back to Detroit, I grabbed my suitcase out of the trunk.

"Got it Bolo?" Dad asked.

"Yes, I have it," as I tried hard to hide the strain in carrying the suitcase to the door and down the stairs straight to the washing machine. The paint on the side door seemed dirty and worn. The landing where I had pivoted to sit on the two stairs as I removed my shoes before entering the kitchen seemed smaller.

I stepped into my old bedroom and was instantly swept back by the wallpaper, an enchanting patchwork of antique ships, steam trains, and hot air balloons drifting among compass roses on a faded cream backdrop, like a boyhood atlas come to life, still charting the dreams I once had.

"Are you hungry, Derrick? Dinner will be ready soon."

"Yes, please."

"Oh, I want you to talk to Walter Booker on Sunday at Church. I talked to Pat. She says that Walter loves U of D High School on Seven Mile Road. The Jesuit Academy starts at seventh grade. You need to take a test to get in." Mom said, knowing that challenging me would pique my interest.

The rejection from Kim during the school year had hurt enough. Now Eugene, who I thought was different, who I thought was my friend, couldn't even be bothered to really look at me anymore. The thought of going back to Law in September made my stomach tight.

But Mom's words sparked something. A chance to leave Law behind? To escape all those memories of crying in empty hallways, of Kim's quick "No," of Eugene turning away like our friendship had never mattered? I wanted that more than anything.

"Tell me about it," I said, trying not to sound too eager.

During those months at Law and that transformative trip to England, I had learned something crucial: my voice mattered not because it sounded like everyone else's, but because it was uniquely mine. Doctor Jones had shown me that excellence could be intellectual and commanding. The sick children in that English hospital had shown me that what I could offer had real value. Even Eugene's rejection had taught me something important about friendship and loyalty.

I did not know anything about U of D. The name sounded impressive, "University of Detroit High School". I liked it. And it was on the other side of town. I would not know anyone there, except Walter, and perhaps that was a good thing!

The wallpaper in my bedroom still showed ships and trains and hot air balloons, but now they looked less like dreams and more like destinations. I was ready to see where they might take me.
