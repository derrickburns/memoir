Chapter 32: Courts of Transformation

My journey to the San Mateo YMCA began years earlier with a simple invitation from James: "Derrick, flag football is cool, but there is not enough action. I prefer basketball. Want to play at lunchtime at Cubberly?"

Cubberly had been James's high school before becoming part of California's community college system. For me, it represented more than just a place to play, it was a chance at redemption. The shame of being cut from middle school baseball and basketball teams during first elimination rounds still burned. The memory of being hit in the face in the outfield at Kranz Park still stung. But James stood with me, offering through his friendship and leadership an opportunity to rid myself of that shame.

James introduced me to a crew that would become my first basketball family. Ed, a 5'11", 220-pound engineer with square glasses and the body of a tight end, played with an intensity that matched his principles, hard but fair. He was the court's conscience, demanding clean play and respect for the game.

Doyle, standing 6'0" and lean at 180 pounds, moved like silk on hardwood. A self-styled ladies' man off the court, he was all business on it, a fierce competitor who loved talking trash but backed it up with laser focus and unwavering courage.

Jerry, the elder statesman at 50, moved deliberately at 5' 10". He showed up consistently, letting the young bulls' comments roll off his back like morning dew. His presence taught me my first lesson about longevity in the game, ego was the enemy of endurance.

And then there was Cleve. At 5'10" and nearly 300 pounds, he was a study in contradiction. A former high school track standout who'd put on 100 pounds since his glory days, Cleve refused to acknowledge that Father Time and weight had slowed him down. He still carried himself with the swagger of that fast sprinter, daring anyone to suggest otherwise. As a probation officer, he was used to dominating grown men, and he brought that same intimidating presence to the court. Cleve was a bully who weaponized fear, challenging everyone, probing for weakness like a predator. When he found it, he pounced without mercy.

The danger Cleve posed wasn't theoretical. When I was assigned to defend him, I learned quickly that his 300-pound frame was a weapon he wielded without mercy. He'd swing elbows and stare me down. I refused to back down, showing fear would only invite more aggression, but I was no fool. An elbow to the teeth meant an expensive trip to the dentist. I learned to defend like a boxer, arms up, never leading with my face.

One day, I heard something different in Cleve's voice when he growled, "Stay out of my face!" The tenor told me this day was special, dangerous. I complied, trusting my instinct. Minutes later, Cleve picked up a 6' 4" player, turned upside down and planted his head on the gym floor. The man started choking, having swallowed his tongue. In a bizarre twist, Cleve then saved the man's life by extracting his tongue from his throat. I retreated to the locker room, grateful that my read of the imminent danger had protected me.

But James, at 6' 4" and north of 240 pounds of solid muscle, was the one everyone watched. He combined physical dominance with a deep understanding of the game. In a gym full of alpha males, he was the quiet force, the uber alpha who let his game do all the talking. Everyone wanted him on their team, and those who played against him relished the challenge while dreading the outcome.

And then there was me. I sucked. There was no gentler way to put it. The muscles I'd built the previous summer were already atrophying. My shot was non-existent. I had no court sense, couldn't dribble with my left hand, and barely managed with my right. I spent more time looking down at the ball than at the game unfolding around me. And I knew it, I really sucked.

Still, I showed up. I wanted to learn. That counted for something.

Cubberly had given me toughness. The YMCA would teach me grace.

When I first stepped onto the court at San Mateo YMCA in 1989, I carried these lessons with me, though I was still struggling to apply them. James had moved on, and now I had to stand on my own. Without his presence, every missed shot and fumbled pass reopened old wounds. The squeak of shoes against polished hardwood and the rhythmic bounce of balls echoing off cinder block walls felt foreign and intimidating. The incident with Cleve had taught me to read danger, but now I needed to learn how to read community.

When the YMCA opened its new Peninsula facility near Highway 92 and US 101, I made a strategic decision: if I couldn't master offense, I'd focus on defense. Defense didn't require natural talent, just determination and grit. Those I had in abundance, forged through years of facing down failure and fear on Cubberly's court.

Eventually, I became a regular. And then, a fixture.

Over three decades at the YMCA, I watched generations of players come and go, their stories unfolding like chapters in an endless book. None hit me harder than Dave's journey. When I first met him, he embodied everything I'd once envied, natural athletic grace and that easy social connection I'd struggled so hard to find. Surrounded by friends and admirers, Dave had what my younger self had dreamed of: acceptance, belonging, status.

Then he vanished. Five years passed before I saw him again, and the Dave who returned was a different man. The cocky swagger was gone, replaced by a quiet focus. Prison had aged him, not just physically but in his eyes, which now carried the weight of hard-earned wisdom. His kindness had a deliberate quality, as if he'd learned its value the hard way. Those friendships I'd once envied had led him down a path that broke my heart.

When Dave returned, I engaged him, welcoming him back. Words caught in my throat, I wanted so desperately to tell him that I see him, that I am here for him. But it felt like too little, too late. Years later, I saw him again, married and happy. The exhale that followed was deep and long, carrying years of worry. He had found peace, and somehow that gave me peace too.

After Dave, I saw the court differently, but it was Denly who showed me how to channel that awareness into action. At 6' 5" and 210 pounds, he carried himself with the same quiet authority as James, but with the added wisdom of age. Fourteen years my senior, Denly had emerged from the San Francisco projects to become a dental professor, retiring after 30 years of teaching. He was living proof that fierce competition and fairness weren't mutually exclusive.

Our connection deepened both on and off the court. Through his family, I learned about his journey from the projects to academia. Our wives, both physicians, strong black women who had carved out success in environments traditionally hostile to their presence, formed their own bond, further enriching our friendship.

From Denly, I learned a graduated approach to maintaining court culture. Where Cleve had taught me to read danger through fear, Denly showed me how to read it through understanding. I developed a three-tiered approach to maintaining order: First, a quiet, private conversation with troublemakers, "That behavior is not tolerated here." If that failed, I'd move to public correction: "That is not our culture here." The word 'culture' was deliberate, it reminded everyone that we were a community with standards, not just random players sharing a court. Finally, for those who only understood force, I'd resort to verbal dominance: "Shut the f*ck up!" It wasn't my preferred approach, but I'd learned from Cleve that some men only respect power. The difference was in the purpose, not to bully, but to protect.

When Denly left for back surgery, the loss hit me with unexpected force, as if I'd lost a father or brother. With James, I had needed protection from Cleve and other alpha males who sought to dominate me. But with Denly, the relationship was different, I no longer needed shelter, only refinement. He had been guiding me toward a version of myself I could barely imagine.

That's when young men began approaching me not just for basketball advice, but for life guidance. Like that twenty-year-old who lingered after a particularly intense game, wiping sweat from his face with his jersey, worry evident in his stance.

"My parents want me to move out," he finally said. The words came out flat, but I could hear the fear beneath them.

I used the patience Denly had modeled, asking questions rather than rushing to solutions. "How do you all get along? Any fighting?"

"No," he replied.

"You like living at home?"

"Yeah."

"What's your work situation?"

"Part-time bartending, when I can get shifts." He shrugged, bouncing a basketball absently.

I saw myself in his uncertainty, and remembered my own struggles for independence. But I also saw the opportunity to guide him the way Denly would have, with wisdom wrapped in practical advice.

"May I make a suggestion?"

He nodded, catching the ball.

"How much could you afford in rent each month? Something you know you could pay, no matter what?"

"Maybe $200, $300," he said after a moment's calculation.

"Here's what I'd do. Ask for a family meeting. Offer them that amount in rent. But only if you're sure you can pay it consistently."

Six months later, he caught me before a game, grinning. 

"How did you know that would work?"

"Your parents weren't trying to get rid of you," I explained, thinking of how Denly would have handled this moment. 

"They just needed to know you were on the path to standing on your own."

The circle was complete. From the scared outsider at Cubberly, protected by James, challenged by Cleve, refined by Denly, I had become someone who could now guide others. The court had transformed me, and through me, would help transform others. This was Denly's true legacy, not just the lessons he taught, but the leaders he lifted.
