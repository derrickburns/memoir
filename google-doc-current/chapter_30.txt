Chapter 30: Searching for Black Excellence: A Parallel Journey

Finding Community While Rebuilding Career (2000-2004)

As my professional journey rose and fell through NetApp, Trovix, Google, and Orbital Data, another story was quietly unfolding, a quest for community among fellow Black professionals in Silicon Valley. While the previous chapter mapped my path through corporate waters, this one traces my parallel search for belonging in the Bay Area’s small but distinguished Black professional community.

In the fall of 2000, still nursing wounds from my departure from NetApp, Kirk called with an unexpected suggestion.

"Have you ever considered joining The Boule?" he asked casually over lunch.

"The what?"

"Sigma Pi Phi. The Boule. It's a fraternity for accomplished Black professionals."

I nearly laughed out loud. Me, joining a fraternity? The timing felt absurd. Kirk inviting me, a recently unemployed professional, to join a prestigious fraternity would have been unimaginable in thriving Black communities like those in Atlanta, Chicago, or Washington D.C. But in Silicon Valley, where our numbers were so few, perhaps the rules were different.

Initially, the idea of a fraternity conjured images of hazing rituals and blind loyalty, concepts I had always resisted. Kirk quickly reassured me: this was a graduate fraternity, free of hazing, comprising accomplished Black men who deeply understood the experience of being "the only one."

When Kirk introduced Gina and me at their annual Valentine's Day Formal, we were warmly welcomed with genuine offers of friendship. These men appreciated that merely reaching Silicon Valley as a Black professional was itself an achievement. They cared less about my current job status and more about whether I would positively contribute to their community.

“Roy, this is Derrick. I’m trying to get him to join,” Kirk introduced.

“Hi, Derrick! Welcome. It’s a pleasure to meet you. You should join!”

And so it went, as Kirk introduced me to Frank Greene,  Samuel Johnson, Frederick Chancellor, and others. Ken Coleman, a long-time member, was also present. Was I truly being invited to join a fraternity alongside Ken Coleman?

“Kirk, what’s Roy’s last name?” I asked.

“Clay,” Kirk answered.

Then it clicked, I recognized some of these names. Roy Clay and Frank Greene were featured alongside Marc Hannah in a pivotal 1984 Ebony article celebrating pioneering Black technologists in Silicon Valley, a time when Detroit was still synonymous with automobiles. As a young man, reading about these trailblazers had revealed a world where Black excellence extended beyond traditional industries and into the burgeoning tech sector. Roy Clay, famously dubbed the “Godfather of Silicon Valley,” had led Hewlett-Packard's pioneering computer division in the 1960s and later advised venture capital firms investing in companies like Intel and Compaq. Frank Greene had developed revolutionary semiconductor memory systems at Fairchild Semiconductor, founded multiple successful tech companies, and became one of the first Black venture capitalists committed to funding women and minority entrepreneurs.

Roy and Frank weren't merely technical pioneers, they had actively paved pathways for other Black professionals in a predominantly white industry. Meeting them face-to-face now, especially after witnessing the impact of accomplished Black colleagues at SGI, underscored a powerful realization: Black professionals were indeed shaping Silicon Valley, and I was thrilled at the prospect of joining this esteemed community.

First Impressions (December 2000)

Still doubtful, I agreed to attend their Christmas celebration at Carmel Valley Ranch with Gina. Walking into that gathering felt strangely familiar, yet distinctly different from any professional setting I'd experienced in Silicon Valley.

I found myself among distinguished Black men in suits and their equally accomplished wives. Most were old enough to be my father, yet they carried themselves with a quiet dignity that commanded respect without demanding it.

Just like the men at Metropolitan Baptist Church who had shaped my youth, these brothers displayed a particular bearing, that blend of confidence and humility unique to Black professionals who had succeeded despite systemic barriers. But instead of Detroit's automotive industry executives and small business owners, here were Silicon Valley pioneers and academic leaders.

As Gina and I circulated through the room, each introduction brought a new revelation of excellence.

Mr. John Arnold, the chapter president, commanded respect with his powerful presence. At over 50 years old, it was his physique that caught my attention, huge biceps that reminded me of my Uncle Tom. John modestly said he was in finance, omitting that he was a senior corporate finance executive at Levi Strauss, where he had worked for two decades. His voice carried both authority and compassion. After his corporate career, he had dedicated himself to community service, coordinating programs that provided healthy aging support.

Professor Lucius Barker, the elder statesman of the chapter, reminded me of the way Dad's generation had quietly integrated Detroit's workplaces. As Stanford's William Bennett Munro Professor of Political Science and the second Black president of the American Political Science Association, he had opened doors that would never close again. When he greeted me with special warmth because of our Stanford connection and upon learning my father's family had roots in Louisiana like his own, I felt that same embrace of mentorship I’d felt from Doctor Morton. His gentle manner blended with scholarly authority, making him both approachable and deeply respected among his peers.

Doctor Robert Floyd, with his gentle manner and careful speech, brought back memories of Dad. Having risen from humble beginnings in rural Mississippi under Jim Crow segregation to become our country's second African-American Naval Flight Surgeon and a distinguished OB/GYN, he embodied quiet triumph over systemic barriers. Though soft-spoken, his accomplishments spoke volumes, Chief of Staff at Alexian Brothers Hospital, Clinical Professor at Stanford, and president of our Boule chapter following John Arnold. His meticulous attention to detail and unwavering integrity, even in casual conversation, reflected the discipline that had carried him through decades of pioneering work in medicine.

"What do you think?" Gina whispered as we drove home that evening.

"They remind me of home," I said, surprised by the realization. "Of Detroit. Of the men at Metropolitan."

"But?"

"But this is Silicon Valley. The context is so different."

These California men, like their Detroit counterparts, had achieved excellence not by shouting about it, but by quietly proving their worth day after day. They had faced different challenges than the Detroit generation, integrating Silicon Valley boardrooms instead of auto plants, breaking barriers in West Coast universities rather than Detroit factories, but they carried themselves with that same combination of strength and humility I'd grown up admiring.

And boy could they party!  We all danced until the last song by the live band.  After the formal dinner dance, Gina and I were exhausted.  The next morning, we dragged our tired bodies out of bed and walked across the street to the recommended Sunday brunch spot.  As we arrived, Linda and Hugh Burroughs walked out.

“Good morning, sleepy heads!” Linda blurted out.

“When did you all get here for breakfast?” Gina asked.

“Almost 2 hours ago!” Linda announced.

“What?!  You all party hard!” I said

“Oh yes. We may be old, but we are fun!” Linda said.

And with that, I decided to apply for membership!

Joining the Brotherhood (2001)

By spring 2001, I had completed Boule's initiation process, a dignified series of interviews and social gatherings that bore no resemblance to the fraternity hazings I'd feared. The induction ceremony itself was formal and solemn, emphasizing the organization's founding principles of excellence, service, and brotherhood.

The San Jose chapter was a gathering of accomplished Black men who understood what it meant to be the only one in the room throughout their careers. Like veterans swapping war stories, they found solace in each other's company, a shared understanding that they weren't alone in their experiences.

The chapter's humility struck me. These men, doctors, lawyers, executives, rarely spoke of their achievements. Instead, they sought genuine connection, a space where they could let down the professional masks they wore daily. When they invited me to take on the role of treasurer, I was touched by how these accomplished men made room for a younger member without pretense.

Each month, we gathered in a small banquet room at the Biltmore Hotel and Suites in Santa Clara, just off Highway 101. The setting was comparable to the Fellowship Hall of Metropolitan Baptist Church. Like those Sunday afternoons in Doctor Morton's office, these meetings were about building connections, sharing wisdom, and supporting each other's journeys.

The conversations reminded me of listening to Uncle Bubba, Mr. Russell Rickey, and my Dad in the Metropolitan Baptist Church Trustee Room, but instead of joking while talking about church finances, these men joked while talking about the changing American political environment! Yet beneath the different vocabulary, the fundamental challenges remained the same, being us in a world that would prefer that we disappear.

One evening stands out particularly in my memory, when Tyrone Willingham, Stanford's head football coach, came to speak in the fall of 2001. His presence commanded attention much like Reverend Charles Morton had at Metropolitan, but instead of preaching from a pulpit, he spoke about excellence on the football field and in the classroom. His perfectly pressed clothing and military bearing reminded me of how Dad always insisted on presenting himself impeccably to the world.

"At Stanford," Willingham explained, "our recruiting standards are not a limitation to our football team, they are a competitive advantage."

His words echoed the lessons I'd learned in Detroit, that excellence wasn't just about individual achievement, but about lifting up the entire community. Looking around that room, I saw the same pride in these men's eyes that I'd seen in Detroit when someone in our community achieved something significant. Whether in Detroit's automotive industry or Silicon Valley's tech sector, these were men who understood that their success wasn't just personal, it was paving the way for others to follow.

Two Models of Black Excellence (2002)

By 2002, as my confidence rebounded from my experience at NetApp, I began to seriously consider my long-term aspirations in Silicon Valley. The dot-com bubble had burst, significantly reshaping the industry landscape, and the timing felt right to explore new opportunities.

Venture capital had always intrigued me, the capacity to fund innovation, shape technology trends, and determine which ideas and entrepreneurs would thrive. Given the notable lack of venture capital funding directed toward Black founders, I saw an opportunity to effect meaningful change.

My Boule brothers Roy Clay and Frank Greene, pioneers in both technology and investment, reignited my early excitement when I first read about them. Inspired, I decided to approach them for guidance.

Months later, summoning the courage honed through countless basketball challenges, I visited Frank Greene in his downtown Palo Alto office, situated just above Il Fornaio, one of my favorite spots. The elegant, quiet professionalism of his workspace sharply contrasted with the gritty basketball courts I knew so well. I shared my ambitions in venture capital, hoping for the supportive guidance I had found among my San Jose Boule brothers.

The gap between expectation and reality hit me hard. Frank's office felt starkly solitary, no junior partners, no assistants, just Frank himself. When I asked about apprenticing under him, his response was swift, direct, and crushing:

"Derrick, you'd be better off leveraging your connections in the venture capital world. I have nothing to offer you."

His words struck me deeply. It wasn't merely disappointment; it was devastation. Frank wasn't rejecting me personally; rather, he revealed a grim truth: his path was isolated, solitary, without followers. Leaving his office felt like receiving a terminal diagnosis. Was my journey toward greatness blocked by an insurmountable barrier? I had expected Frank, as a pioneering Black investor, to embrace my interest and show me the way forward. Instead, his advice directed me back toward the predominantly white networks controlling access to capital.

Walking back to my car, I contemplated the stark differences between Detroit and Silicon Valley. In Detroit, leaders like Doctor Morton provided clear paths and mentorship, backed by robust Black institutions. In contrast, even successful Silicon Valley pioneers like Frank remained isolated, lacking the kind of enduring networks that foster future generations.

Detroit's Black community had deliberately constructed parallel institutions, churches, businesses, social organizations, that emphasized collective progress and mutual support. Frank’s reality highlighted something profoundly different: Silicon Valley’s landscape required integration into existing, predominantly white networks. Brown v. Board of Education had declared separate inherently unequal, but here, perhaps, separate had offered something better.

Finding My Way (2003-2004)

Over the following months, I reflected deeply on Frank's painful but illuminating advice and the stark contrasts between Detroit and Silicon Valley models of Black advancement. Gradually, clarity replaced the initial hurt. Frank wasn’t dismissing my ambitions; he was providing a brutally honest map of the landscape he knew too well.

The San Jose Boule offered another form of invaluable strength, not institutional power, but authentic community. Our monthly meetings reminded me of the comforting fellowship of Sunday afternoons at Metropolitan Baptist Church. Doctors, lawyers, and executives could remove their professional armor and authentically connect with brothers who understood their shared experiences.

By early 2004, as I began my role at Orbital Data, these seemingly contradictory lessons converged. Detroit had instilled in me the power of community and collective support. Silicon Valley figures like Frank taught me to navigate predominantly white spaces without sacrificing my authenticity.

Yet, the lessons were sobering. SGI and Frank had proven to be exceptions rather than standard-bearers, unable to establish lasting legacies or pathways for others. SGI was fading, and Frank remained largely isolated in venture capital.

Frank’s blunt message reflected Silicon Valley’s harsh reality: there were no clear roads, no enduring mentorship structures or parallel institutions to replicate Detroit’s strength. Models of Black excellence here were predominantly individual rather than institutional.

Recognizing this reality reshaped my purpose. Perhaps it was now my task to build those pathways that did not yet exist.
