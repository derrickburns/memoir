Chapter 10: Performing Identity

A Winter's Bluff

What year are we in?Snow crunched under my boots as Bill and I crossed the Northwest Rec Center parking lot. The bass from inside thumped against the cold air, Kool & the Gang competing with the wind. We were far from my northeast side neighborhood - the rec center sat on the west side of Detroit, but word was the party would be worth the drive.

"Look who's in that Land Rover," Bill muttered, nodding toward the idling vehicle.

Through the open passenger window, I spotted Leslie - Leslie who was halfway through her junior year at Princeton, where I was finishing my first semester. I'd seen her at plenty of parties before, but those were always word-of-mouth affairs in private homes, church basements, or rented halls. Northwest Rec was just a public recreation center, open to anyone who showed up. Two young men stood by the passenger door, leaning into the conversation.

"Derrick. Bill." Leslie's voice was quiet, controlled.

"These are our boyfriends."

One of the men stepped back from the window.

"Uh huh. I see what's happening," he muttered, cursing under his breath.

His friend followed his lead, both of them backing away into the darkness.

We made small talk about the holidays, about Princeton, about Yale - all of us performing normalcy while the muffled sounds of "Celebration" leaked from the rec center's walls. Finally, I made our exit:

"Well, if you're not coming in, we'll catch you later."

But halfway to Mom's lime green 1978 Bonneville Brougham, I caught movement in my peripheral vision. The two men had returned with reinforcements - five or six more figures emerging from the shadows of the parking lot. The math changed instantly. No way to reach the car in time.

I unzipped my leather jacket with deliberate precision, making a show of reaching into my vest pocket. The gesture needed to look natural. They couldn't know I was bluffing.

It worked. They scattered into the darkness as quickly as they'd appeared. Bill and I made it to the car, drove away with the windows down despite the cold, letting the winter air blast through. My pulse pounded so hard it hurt my neck.

We didn't speak during the drive home. The cold air whipping through the windows helped clear my head, but questions kept spinning: Why were Leslie and Lynn really there? What would have happened if those guys hadn't bought my bluff? What if they'd called it?

Back home, I lay in bed staring at my ceiling, too wired to sleep. The adrenaline had faded, leaving me exhausted but restless. I'd pulled it off - played the role those guys needed to see to leave me alone. But man, pretending to be tough was draining. One wrong move, one slip in the performance, and disaster!

The whole scene felt surreal now. Leslie and Lynn, Ivy League students home for break, mixed up with guys at Northwest Rec. Me, three months into Princeton, still having to navigate Detroit's unwritten rules. All of us wore different masks depending on where we were, who we were with, what was needed to stay safe.

The Northwest Rec scene could have played out differently. But by that winter night in '81, I'd had years of practice reading situations, knowing which version of myself to present. It hadn't always been so smooth.

Learning the Roles

This wasn't always so smooth. Learning to read situations and present the right version of myself took practice, and high school was where I perfected the skill.

About ninety new students entered U of D's freshman class. Many came from the suburbs on school buses, bringing their own unwritten rules and expectations.

The school sorted some kids into an honors program, including Tim Devine and William Doss, Wardell's grade school friend from Lafayette Park. I wanted to be with them and the other smart kids, but Mom said I should stay where I was since I'd already skipped a grade.

I made friends with several of the new white kids. Tom Doyle seemed really smart. Tim Devine seemed very nice, with older brothers already at The High. His mom led the Mother's Club. I heard Jerry Cahalan's dad was a Wayne County Prosecutor.

Then I met a couple of guys who had noses and hair like mine. They were Chaldean. The other kids called them A-Rabs, and soon I was hearing that too. I'd seen adults who looked like them at the grocery store on Conant and 7 Mile Road.

We didn't have much choice with history. It was required, and I hated it almost as much as social studies in 7th and 8th grade. I found memorizing dates boring, so I waited until the day before the exam to commit them to short term memory. Two days later, those memories were gone! Why does it matter that the Civil War was fought between 1862 and 1865?

By contrast, I loved my English classes. In the academy we'd focused on grammar and rules, but now we did a lot more reading and writing. With writing, I could argue my point without interruption. No heckling. No shouting.

I was learning to read the different groups and their unspoken rules. The suburban kids seemed to understand things about social positioning that the city kids took for granted. There were expectations about dress, about language, about family background that I was just beginning to notice. Each group had its own way of establishing who belonged and who didn't.

The success of seventh and eighth grade had proven that I could handle the academics.  I could win debates, I could analyze problems that stumped other kids. That intellectual confidence felt solid, unshakeable. When someone challenged me on facts or logic, I never backed down because I trusted my mind. I had no problem admitting when I was wrong intellectually, that was just data, just learning. Intellectual battles felt safe because I knew my weapons worked.

When conversations turned to parties or hero worship of athletes and bullies, I felt disgusted more than threatened. The faux toughness was the same gang-like behavior I'd seen in second grade, teasing, bullying, cliquishness. It was all abhorrent to me. Some boys seemed to only feel confident when they expressed dominance, and I resented that whole dynamic. But with girls, it was different, I felt completely comfortable, safe even. More than safe. From my experiences with Mary and my sister-cousins, I'd learned how to be vulnerable with girls, how to just be myself. Around them, I felt like I was floating in salt water on a warm sunny day, relaxed, soothed, completely at ease.

It was with those dominance-seeking boys that I retreated to higher ground. "What you think doesn't matter because I am intellectually superior," became my silent mantra. I'd steer conversations back to academics, politics, anything where I could regain control. My real intellectual gifts became shields against the vulnerability of genuine social connection.

Jimmy showed me a different way. His weapon was humor, sharp, biting critiques of others and himself that could cut through any tension. But unlike my intellectual retreat, Jimmy stayed in the social arena. He wanted people to laugh, wanted to secure the floor, and when he couldn't get the audience's attention, he just stayed quiet. No antagonism, no retreat to some claim of superiority. He didn't seem afraid of what people thought, as long as they were willing to let him entertain them.

I told myself I didn't need other boys' approval, mainly because I was afraid of rejection. The only friends I made were those who weren't playing the mainstream approval game, the gentle, soft-spoken boys who had found their own quiet strength, the closeted gay boys who had their own reasons for staying outside the system, and Jimmy, whose boisterous authenticity cut through all the performance. These boys had discovered ways to be themselves without seeking external validation, and I admired that courage even as I hid behind my intellectual armor.

I could win any debate, but I was learning that being right wasn't the same as being connected. And every space still required a different version of myself, it was just that my default version was becoming the smartest guy in the room, whether that's what the situation called for or not.

When Jimmy was struggling with Mr. Baugh's English class, I went over to his house to help him write an essay.

"Come on in D, let's go in the basement," Jimmy said, as I entered his house on Renfrew.

"Ok, let me see what you have written," I said.

As I read the essay, I could see a few differences between his approach and mine.

"D, just tell me what to do," Jimmy surrendered.

So we spent the next two hours rewriting. I told Jimmy there must be a logic to the argument. Each sentence is like a step along a path. When we finished, the essay was as good as any that I would write.

When Jimmy received a "D", he was crushed and I was mystified. That essay would have gotten me an "A". I know it.

Jimmy's mom went to the school to meet with the principal. I don't know what she said, but Mr. Baugh was gone after the next semester.

The incident taught me something important about the unwritten rules of academic performance. I understood what teachers wanted to see, how to structure arguments, how to present ideas in ways that earned grades. Jimmy was just as smart as me, but he hadn't learned to read the system the same way. It wasn't about intelligence, it was about knowing the performance they expected.

Social Performances

Jimmy told me about a party Saturday night at Plymouth Church. A party at a church? I'd been to plenty of roller skating parties sponsored by Corinthian, but those were family events for all ages. This was different.

"Everybody is going to be there, D," Jimmy said.

I wore my best clothes, polyester brown pants, yellow v-neck polyester sweater, and brown dress shoes. But walking into that church basement stopped me cold. This wasn't just some basic room with folding chairs and punch. There were decorations everywhere, a DJ spinning records through massive speakers, light bouncing off a disco ball. The setup was as sophisticated as anything I'd seen.

What struck me most were the girls. I met girls from Mercy, our sister high school in Farmington Hills, some from Cass Tech, and a few from Renaissance. One of them told me she was going to be in the Cotillion. Jimmy explained that it was a Debutante Ball, whatever that was. These weren't the working-class girls I'd grown up around, daughters of teachers, postal workers, factory workers. These girls talked differently, carried themselves differently, expected different things.

But I felt comfortable. With girls, I always felt comfortable. From Mary and my sister-cousins, I'd learned how to be vulnerable, how to just be myself. Around girls, I felt like I was floating in salt water on a warm sunny day, relaxed, soothed, completely at ease.

That's why what happened with Tiffany shocked me so much.

I'd given her my number at one of those Plymouth Church parties. When Dad dropped me off at the movie theater, I found her and her friends in the ticket line. In the darkness of the theater, we kissed, paying no attention to the movie or her friends. Everything felt natural, easy, like it always did with girls.

Her friend offered to drive me home after. I directed them east, across town, far from their familiar west side neighborhoods. As we pulled up to my house, I leaned back in for one last kiss.

"No!"

The violence in her voice shocked me. Her friends turned around from the front seat to witness my humiliation. I closed the car door, my mind spinning to understand how the same kiss could be welcome in the theater but threatening in my driveway.

Inside my house, I couldn't make sense of it. What was different? The same girl, the same me, the same kiss. But something about the context, my neighborhood, my house, something I couldn't name, had changed everything. I never heard from her again.

That's when I started paying attention to questions I'd never been asked before. Where did I live? What did my parents do? Which church did we attend? I was very confident I could perform well in these conversations, I had the right answers, the right way of presenting myself. But perhaps I was unaware of the role I was auditioning for.

I wasn't interested in their world for its own sake, the Cotillion Clubs and Jack and Jill organizations that I'd eventually learn about held no appeal for me. But if that's where the girls were, if that's what I had to navigate to connect with them, then I'd learn the rules. My comfort with girls was real, but apparently it wasn't enough. Context mattered in ways I was just beginning to understand.

The rejection stung, but it also taught me something crucial: the same person could get different reactions in different settings. If I wanted to succeed with girls across these different worlds, I'd have to learn to read the room, not just trust my natural ease. My floating-in-salt-water comfort had limits I'd never known existed.

Finding Authentic Leadership

What made me decide to do cheerleading despite potential ridicule? In a word: Jimmy!

If Jimmy was willing to lead, I was willing to follow. Something about his presence let me translate my intellectual confidence into social confidence. No, I wasn't playing basketball for the school, I'd been cut from the teams in 7th grade. Jimmy had been cut later too. But if Jimmy had the audacity to stand up and cheer after being cut, I could too. I would shake off whatever shame I might have carried and boldly claim space in front of the crowd with him. I would shout!

At an all-boys school, there wasn't anyone else to do it anyway. We were the only guys willing to get the crowd going, and we owned it completely.

"Who are we?!" we yelled before the basketball games. "U of D!!" the crowd responded. "Who are we?" we yelled louder! "U of D!" the crowd screamed.

Every Friday night game, we'd get the whole gym going crazy. I'd leave hoarse from screaming our chants: "We are, [stomp] [stomp]" "U of D [stomp] [stomp]!"

This was my house! In that gym, leading those cheers, I wasn't performing, I was claiming my space, claiming a voice, and challenging anyone to attempt to ridicule me. I was fearless. While cheerleading obviously was a performance, it didn't feel like one. It felt like the most authentic thing I'd ever done. I wasn't retreating to intellectual superiority or calculating what role to play. Jimmy had shown me how to step forward instead of step back, how to claim space instead of defending it.

The cheerleading wasn't about athletics, it was about claiming space, about refusing to apologize for who we were. Some people talked trash, but we didn't care. We were providing something the school needed, and we were good at it. For the first time, I felt what real leadership was like, not the intellectual dominance I used as armor with other boys, not the careful class performances I was learning for dating, but genuine confidence that didn't require putting anyone down or hiding anything about myself.

That confidence got tested in a different way when rumors circulated that I was in trouble with some guys from school. The trouble had started a few weeks earlier when, bored one Saturday afternoon, I'd driven to visit one of the girls I'd met at YMCA residential camp. When we arrived, I parked the car and rang the bell.

"Hi Derrick! Come on in!" she said.

As we sat in the living room, I realized her parents weren't home. Then came the big surprise - her boyfriend, a popular athlete from my high school, walked out. Wardell got visibly nervous, but I decided to show that I wasn't. She was my friend long before she was his girlfriend, and she gave me no hint that my presence wasn't welcome. We stayed for an hour.

The next week at school, rumors circulated that I was in trouble. I was warned not to come to the basketball game. I went anyway, but slipped out early before the crowd dispersed.

The walk home that night was long and cold. I stuck to the side streets, jumping at shadows, my heart racing every time a car approached. By the time I made it home, my fingers were numb from the winter air, but something else had crystallized inside me: anger. Pure, clarifying anger.

No. I wouldn't be chased away like this. After all, I had already found my place at The High, even if it wasn't where anyone expected.

"Nothing will happen, Glenn," I told him before the next game. "These guys think they are tough, but they are all talk."

So the next game, we arrived early. Glenn's large 6'5" frame and his hair cornrowed made him look pretty imposing. As the crowd filed into the seats in the bleachers of the school gym, something strange happened. By game time, all the bleachers were full, except for all the seats within five feet of where Glenn and I sat.

The message was clear, and so was my response. I wasn't running, wasn't retreating to intellectual superiority, wasn't trying to perform my way out of a threat. I was claiming my space and daring anyone to challenge it.

"Hey D. Hey Glenn," Jimmy approached, breaking the ice like nothing was wrong.

"Hey Jimmy," Glenn responded in his slow, easy drawl.

Jimmy's willingness to approach us despite the obvious tension showed me something about authentic friendship. He wasn't calculating the social cost or worrying about what others might think. He just came over because we were his friends.

This was what authentic assertiveness looked like, and I was learning it from Jimmy, not the quiet, gentle boys I'd been drawn to, not the intellectual equals I could debate with, but from the boisterous friend who had the courage to be himself completely, even after being told he wasn't good enough for the teams. Whether leading cheers or facing down threats, Jimmy showed me how to step forward instead of stepping back, how to claim space instead of defending it.

Questions Emerge

By second semester senior year, these performances had become second nature. Maybe that's why Father Radloff's Ethics and Morality class hit differently. Instead of just making us read books, he got us thinking about real stuff. His handouts broke down heavy Catholic teaching so it made sense. Like with the Final Option Theory, he explained that the choices you make every day become habits. So if you're always choosing to do bad stuff, that's probably what you'll choose at the end too.

That idea stuck with me, but not because I was getting exhausted. I was starting to gain confidence. When I invited Glenn to join me at the game, it was partially out of real fear, but more about pushing back, claiming my space as a young man who was determined not to be afraid. This wasn't about switching between versions of myself anymore, it was about choosing who I wanted to become.

I loved the debates in Father Radloff's class. When he asked, "Is abortion moral?" I didn't speak up to win the argument. I spoke up to find a moral path that felt authentic to me. These weren't just philosophical questions, they hit at the heart of my own existence, my own beginning. My birth mother had made a choice. My parents had made a choice. Now I was making choices about who to be.

Father Radloff's teachings actually mirrored my Christian teachings at Metropolitan. The difference was, Father Radloff asked me what I thought, opening the door for exploration. At Metropolitan, we learned what to believe. Here, I was learning how to think through what I believed and why.

I had learned to navigate different worlds, intellectual battles with boys who sought dominance, class-conscious spaces to connect with girls, authentic leadership in front of crowds. But Father Radloff's questions made me realize I wasn't just switching between roles anymore. I was integrating them, choosing which parts of each context brought out something real in me.

The choices I was making every day were becoming habits, just like Father Radloff said. But instead of losing myself in all the different performances, I was starting to find myself through them. Each situation was teaching me something about who I wanted to be, not just who I needed to be to survive.

And as importantly, I had several deep and emotionally fulfilling relationships with boys and girls that created spaces where I could explore safely. These weren't the class-conscious dating performances or the intellectual armor battles. These were genuine connections where I could be vulnerable, ask questions, and discover parts of myself I hadn't known existed. In these relationships, I wasn't performing at all, I was just being, and learning what that felt like.

The Cost and the Promise

As senior year wound down, I took stock of what I'd learned. I could navigate intellectual battles with dominance-seeking boys, slip smoothly between different class contexts when dating, and claim space fearlessly when leading crowds. I'd become sophisticated at reading rooms and presenting whichever version of myself each situation required.

But more importantly, I'd discovered something deeper. Through Father Radloff's questions about daily choices becoming habits, I wasn't just switching between performances anymore, I was choosing who I wanted to become. Each context taught me something about authentic strength, whether it was Jimmy's social fearlessness, the gentle boys' quiet confidence, or my own emerging ability to stand up without putting others down.

The deep, emotionally fulfilling relationships I'd built with both boys and girls had shown me what it felt like to explore safely, to be vulnerable without armor, to discover parts of myself I hadn't known existed. In those connections, I wasn't performing at all, I was just being, and learning what that felt like.

Standing in the lunch line at The High one day near graduation, I overheard two classmates talking. These weren't just any classmates, they were white kids whose parents had made the supposedly progressive choice to send them from the suburbs into Detroit for an education alongside black students.

"I heard you got into Princeton," one blurted, his voice carrying a challenge that stripped away years of polite coexistence.

The other, our valedictorian, stood silently beside him, his silence its own form of complicity.

"You don't deserve it. You're going to fail," the first one charged.

I walked away, their words following me like shadows. But my steps were firm. I knew where I was going.

I'd spent four years learning to navigate different worlds, becoming skilled at giving people what they wanted to see. But I'd also learned what authentic confidence felt like, not the intellectual armor I'd used for protection, not the class performances I'd mastered for dating success, but the real thing. The fearless space-claiming of cheerleading, the moral exploration of Father Radloff's classroom, the safe vulnerability of genuine relationships.

Princeton represented something I'd been moving toward without fully understanding it, a place where I wouldn't have to choose which version of myself to be. Where intellectual confidence could exist without armor, where authentic exploration was encouraged, where I could build on the genuine connections I'd already learned to make.

The skills I'd developed would serve me well, I knew how to read different contexts, how to adapt when necessary, how to claim space when challenged. But more than that, I'd learned the difference between performing and being, between surviving and thriving, between armor and authentic strength.

I was ready for whatever came next.
