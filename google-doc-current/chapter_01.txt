Chapter 1: Two Worlds Converging

Years later, I would piece together the story of how I came to be—two separate lives converging at Crittenton Hospital in April 1964, creating the mystery that would define my childhood.

My birth mother had lived for months in the maternity home's quiet corridors, where strict rules shielded dozens of young women from the world's judgment. Twenty-two years old, almost finished with her degree, her own divorce not yet final. A Jewish woman pregnant by a Black law student—a scandal that would shake both their communities. In 1964 Detroit, such racial and religious boundaries weren't merely social; they were fiercely maintained lines between worlds. Her parents had arranged her stay, determined to shield their eldest daughter from scrutiny.

Across town, my future mother Willa Burns graded papers at her dining room table, trying to ignore the empty nursery down the hall. Each month brought the same disappointment, the same quiet grief. Her heart lifted briefly during visits to her sister, where children's laughter rang through the house—both a joy and a sharp reminder of what she longed for. Her husband Howard watched helplessly, carrying his own private pain from a son he couldn't reach, couldn't hold, couldn't father.

As spring arrived, my birth mother's time at Crittenton was ending. Through long nights, she had felt me kicking strong and insistent against her ribs, an innocent rebellion against the boundaries already shaping my future.

The phone call came on an April morning. A baby boy, the adoption supervisor told my parents. Mixed race. Beautiful. Healthy. Available immediately. Mom's hand trembled on the receiver, her quiet voice betraying her deepest fear.

"Howard, a mixed child—what if people don't believe I'm his mother?"

Dad met her eyes with quiet resolve. "Willa, you don't select a child like a pair of shoes."

In the hospital, my birth mother held me once, memorizing my face, my scent, the warmth of my small body. Perfect fingers, dark curls, skin lighter than my father's. She named me Michael, though she knew the name wouldn't last. Then she left Crittenton Hospital alone, carrying an ache she would hold for thirty-three years.

For five weeks, I lived between worlds—neither with my birth mother nor my adoptive parents, in temporary care while papers were processed. Even in those earliest days, I existed in the spaces between categories, between families, between identities that adults would spend years trying to make fit.

When Mom and Dad finally brought me home, a colleague of my Mom hung a sign that would witness decades of life unfolding:

"Congratulations to Derrick Raynard for getting such wonderful, loving parents!"

I remember staring up at those bright letters in our basement, puzzled by their meaning.

"Mom, what did I do to get congratulated?" I asked one day.

She smiled, wrapping me in a warm hug, explaining again about being "chosen" and "special"—words that somehow left me more confused. If they chose me, where had I been before? Who hadn't chosen me?

The space between "chosen" and "belonging" would become the defining geography of my childhood, where love and uncertainty coexisted, where gratitude and confusion lived side by side.

Four lives had intersected at Crittenton Hospital—a birth mother, a baby, and a married couple, each forever changed. But the true intersection, where identity meets truth and vulnerability meets courage, would take much longer to find.

That journey was just beginning.
