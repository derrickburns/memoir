Chapter 3: Lessons from Aunt Mae

With Nursery School over, Mom found other free respite from childcare duties in the form of her sister and surrogate mother, Classie Mae Walker, Aunt Mae to me. Aunt Mae was like the film negative of Mom: tall, buxom, and welcoming.

"You will get your education so you don't have to wash white people's clothes or take care of white people's babies," Aunt Mae had told Mom years before, as Mom repeated to me throughout my childhood.

But whereas Aunt Mae had been a mother to Mom, with all the attendant expectations and discipline of the head of household, she was more a grandmother to me. And when the weekends came, I loved to hear the magical words: "Derrick, get ready to go to Aunt Mae's house!"

Mom's voice sent me flying upstairs, two steps at a time, yanking my overnight bag from under the bed. The zipper caught on my pajama sleeve as I stuffed everything in, but nothing could slow me down. Through the window, I spotted Mom's car already warming up, its exhaust making clouds in the evening air.

No Primary Church this Sunday. No standing straight and smiling at exactly the right moments. No getting in trouble for whispering to Mary like last week when Mom was our teacher and made me sit in the front row by myself, my face burning while everyone stared.

The familiar drive down Nevada Street to 18606 Mackay felt longer than usual. Before Mom could fully stop the car, I spotted Uncle John on the porch.

"Hey Boy!" he greeted me as I scrambled out of the car.

"Hi Uncle John!"

"Can we play checkers?" I asked.

"Boy, you don't know nothin' about no checkers," he said, smiling.

Before disappointment could run too deep, Aunt Mae came to the door.

"Shug!" Aunt Mae called.

Everyone had their favorite nickname for me. I suppose it was short for “sugar”, but all I know is that when I heard it, I felt good inside.  

The screen door creaked its welcome as she pulled me close. She smelled like vanilla and fabric softener, and something in my chest loosened at the familiar scent—something I hadn't even realized was tight.

Friday Night Rituals

"Shug, come help me fix your bed," Aunt Mae called from the small back bedroom.

I stood next to the mattress while she tucked the sheets, making the corners neat and tight. This simple invitation felt revolutionary. Mom would have shooed me away with an impatient "Go play, Derrick, you're in the way," but Aunt Mae wanted me close.

"Aunt Mae, can I stay up late?"

"We'll see how sleepy you get." She smoothed the quilt with her hands. "But first, you need to wash up."

Standing on the little wooden stool she kept just for me, I reached for the bar of Ivory soap. When I came out in my pajamas, she was sitting in her chair with her Bible open on her lap, the lamp casting a yellow circle around her. She patted the arm of the chair.

"Come sit with me while I read."

I climbed up next to her, fitting myself into the curve of her arm. Her voice was soft and steady as she read about shepherds and sheep, about still waters and green pastures. I didn't understand every word, but the sound of her voice created a different kind of safety—not the safety of rules followed correctly, but the safety of being wanted exactly as I was.

When my eyes grew heavy, she carried me to the little bedroom and tucked me in again, her hand cool on my forehead.

"Sweet dreams, Shug."

Morning Without Rules

The smell of bacon drifted into my dreams before the sun came through the curtains. I padded to the kitchen in bare feet, finding Aunt Mae at the stove.

"Good morning Shug! Can you help me with these eggs?"

She handed me an egg. When pieces of shell fell into the bowl, her fingers moved quickly and gently to fish them out.

We ate at the built-in counter, the eggs still warm from the pan. She cut my toast into triangles without my asking.

"What do you want to do today, Shug?"

The question surprised me. Saturday mornings meant chores and errands, a schedule that moved around my wants, never with them.

"Can I play with Snuffy first?"

"Just watch where you step in that backyard," she warned with a knowing smile.

I bolted outside to find Snuffy, Aunt Mae's golden collie, sprawled in a sunny patch near the fence. At the sight of me, her tail started wagging like a furry metronome. We wove between the careful landscape of dog poop that dotted the grass, an obstacle course that made me giggle.

"Come here, girl!" I called, convinced I could ride her like the horses on TV westerns.

When I finally cornered her near the back steps and tried to climb on, Snuffy gave me a look that clearly said "Not happening, kid" and trotted away with dignified indifference, leaving me sprawled on the grass laughing.

"Derrick, come wash those hands!" Aunt Mae called from the kitchen door.

"Can we make ice cream now?"

"If you're willing to do the cranking."

"I am! I got stronger since last time!"

Creating Something Together

Crack! The egg split perfectly against the rim of Aunt Mae's white bowl, the one with the tiny chip on the edge that she'd had "since before you were born, Shug."

She handed me her wooden spoon, worn smooth from years of stirring. The mixture fought against my spoon—sugar, eggs, and cream refusing to blend easily.

"Keep going, Shug. Got to get all those little sugar crystals dissolved."

Mom usually opened cans of peaches or scooped store-bought ice cream onto plates. But Aunt Mae carved out entire afternoons for us to make something together.

The wooden bucket sat ready on the back porch, ice and rock salt layered around the metal canister. She fitted the crank handle into place.

"Ready?"

The first few turns were easy. Then the mixture began to freeze, and the handle grew heavy. My shoulders burned, but I kept cranking because she was right there with me, her hands covering mine when I needed help.

When we finally lifted the lid, revealing perfect, creamy swirls inside, she handed me the first spoon.

The ice cream was cold and sweet and perfect. But more than that, it was something we had created together. This bore no resemblance to the store-bought varieties Mom served at home.

After lunch, Aunt Mae left for a couple of hours. With nothing to do, I joined Uncle John on the front porch. He sat there most days, waiting for company to drop by, with a glass of orange juice and ice. Aunt Mae had told me never to touch Uncle John's “juice”.

"Uncle John, can we play checkers?"

"No boy, you are not ready."

And as if on cue, one of Uncle John's friends walked up the walkway to the steps of the porch.

"Hey John, ready to get your butt whooped?"

"Sit down and stop that crazy talk," Uncle John retorted.

And I watched Uncle John play and win. He never lost.

Sunday Belonging

The starch in my Sunday shirt crackled as I followed Aunt Mae up the worn stone steps of Corinthian Baptist Church. The heavy wooden doors groaned open, releasing waves of organ music and the sharp sweetness of ladies' perfume mixed with furniture polish.

In the choir loft, she stood straight and tall, her voice rising above the others, strong and sure: "Aaaah-mazing Graaaace..." I watched her face as she sang, eyes closed, completely lost in the music. The stained glass windows caught the morning sun, painting her face in blues and golds, transforming her into something almost ethereal.

After the service, Reverend Jordan found me in the fellowship hall. "You're getting so tall, Derrick!" He squeezed my shoulders. "Mrs. Walker talks about you all the time!"

"Aunt Mae, can I have a dime for some pop?"

"Let me see if I have a dime, Derrick." She dug through her large purse, finding the coin and pressing it into my palm.

I ran down the worn brown stone steps to the church basement with the same tile floor we had at home, heading for the soda vending machine. At the soda machine, I'd search for Fanta orange pop first. The glass bottles lay horizontally behind the glass. I always checked the coin return to see if someone had left change. If I couldn't find orange, I'd settle for red pop.

When I returned upstairs with my treasure, she was still surrounded by friends. She reached for me automatically, pulling me close to her side while she finished her conversation. Her arm stayed around my shoulders, claiming me.

Here, among these people who called me "Classie's nephew," I felt the same belonging I experienced at Metropolitan Church. But this was different somehow—less about performance, more about simply being present and accepted.

The Shadow of Tomorrow

Later that evening, the phone's shrill ring cut through the quiet house.

"That's probably your mama, checking on you." Aunt Mae rose to answer. "Hello? Yes, Willa, he's been good as gold... No, no trouble at all... What time tomorrow? Alright then."

My stomach dropped at the word "tomorrow." I didn't want tomorrow to come. I wanted to play with Snuffy, watch TV, and eat ice cream!

“Can I stay until dinner time?” I asked, bargaining for just a bit more time to play with Snuffy and be with Aunt Mae.

“That’s up to your Momma.” 

"Aunt Mae?"

"Yes, Shug?"

"Can I come back next weekend?"

"If your mama says it's alright, you're always welcome here."

She meant it. I could hear it in her voice, see it in the way she looked at me, like I was exactly who she'd been hoping to see, every single time.

But what if Mom said no? What if she discovered I preferred it here? The guilt crept in—was I betraying Mom and Daddy for wishing I could stay? Was I ungrateful, bad, for wanting this place where mistakes didn't matter?

When Mom picked me up after church, my overnight bag felt heavier than when I'd arrived. Aunt Mae had packed a Tupperware container of leftover ice cream.

"You be good for your mama now," she said, hugging me tight on the porch.

"I will. Bye, Aunt Mae!"

"Bye, Shug! See you soon."

As I walked down the straight concrete walkway to the sidewalk, I took one more look back.  Snuffy was in the living room picture window. Aunt Mae on the concrete porch. I never felt more loved and more secure than I did in that small two bedroom home.

I got into Mom’s Pontiac, scanning the street.  Mr. Clingman, Aunt Mae’s neighbor to the north,  set the sprinkler head so that the water would reach both sides of the lawn.  

“Bye Bye Derrick”, Mrs. Clingman said from her porch.

“How was your visit with Aunt Mae?” Mom inquired.

“Great!  We made ice cream!” I declared proudly.

“Ah, is that what is in the container?”

“I don’t know, but I hope so!”

In the car, I watched her house shrink in the rear window. Mom talked about our tasks for the week, but I wasn't listening. I was thinking about how Aunt Mae never scolded me. Why couldn’t Mom be more like Aunt Mae?
