Chapter 5: Developing the Picture

"Derrick, go downstairs and get me a can of pork and beans and a can of string beans from the pantry," Mom called from the kitchen.

I headed down the basement stairs, my hand sliding along the wooden banister. The familiar tick-tick-tick of Dad's darkroom timer drifted from behind the closed door next to our pantry. The air down here always smelled different - cooler, with hints of the chemicals Dad used for his pictures.

I retrieved the cans from the pantry, but found myself drawn to that photograph again—the large black and white picture hanging just outside the pantry door. Hundreds of men in uniform stood four deep in perfect military formation. Every time I passed it, I played the same game: find Dad. Second row, seventh from left. There he was, young and serious in his uniform, his face barely distinguishable among the sea of identical soldiers.

For years, that's all I saw—Dad's face among hundreds of others, proof that my quiet father had once been a soldier.

I stared at the photograph, tracing the familiar path to Dad's young face. His expression looked so different from the gentle man who helped me with homework upstairs—more guarded, more careful. As I got older, I'd started noticing other details beyond just finding him. Some men sat in chairs in the very front, looking important and serious, like they were in charge. I'd count them sometimes—maybe fifteen or twenty men in that front row, all sitting while everyone else stood.

"Dad?" I called softly toward the darkroom door.

"Hi Bolo, I'm developing pictures. Don't come in here - you'll ruin the pictures." And I stayed out, but I could imagine Dad dipping the pictures in the trays.  He had let me in before. But once in, I could not leave. I knew the rules.  

I could imagine Dad smiling, as he always did when he called me Bolo.  I wonder what that name meant to him?  

I could see a faint red glow from under the hollow wooden door. I had been in there before, the tiny room that sat just under the stairs to the kitchen. It was not much bigger than a closet really, with makeshift shelves holding developing paper and chemicals. One naked light bulb on a white ceramic fixture with a simple draw string illuminated the room most of the time. But not this time, light, Dad had told me before, would ruin the film. How could light ruin anything, I wondered, but I followed his instructions not to enter. Dad's shadow moved back and forth in the red light like he was performing some kind of magic ritual.

As I stared at the picture, I wondered what Dad felt at that moment.  Was he happy?  How did he feel being so far from home? Were these men his friends?  Was his Mom afraid for him being in the Army? 

Dad never explained. He never talked about the Army, about the segregation, about his time in France. He never talked about his past.  For that matter, he did not talk about himself at all. What I knew about Dad, I learned from Mom.  

I grabbed the cans and headed back upstairs, my mind full of questions about that photograph and the serious young man who would become my father.consider adding a foreshadowing thought, somethnig like “It would be some years before I even understood the right questions to ask” or something like that…..  You need to hint at the racial awakenig which your Mom is avoiding in the next section and which finally hits you at 10 (really it took that long?)

In the Kitchen

"Mom, why are there so many soldiers in that picture downstairs?"

Mom looked up from where she was seasoning the pork chops, her hands pausing mid-motion.

"That's your daddy's company from the war, baby. Company A, 1st Battalion, US Army, Fort McClellan, Alabama, January 1943." The date rolled off her tongue like she'd said it a hundred times.

I set the cans on the counter and climbed onto my usual stool, watching her work.

"What did Dad do in the Army?"

"Mostly he was a cook, but he also learned photography." Mom opened the can of pork and beans, the metal lid curling back with a soft pop. "He served in France during World War II."

"Why are some of the men wearing all white? And why are the white men sitting in front?"

Mom's stirring slowed. She glanced at me, then back at the skillet.

"Well, baby, back then the Army was... different. Black soldiers and white soldiers didn't serve together the same way."

I didn't understand, but something in her voice told me it was important.

"Tell me about Daddy in the war."

Dad's Story

As Mom started the green beans, she told me about Dad coming home to Detroit in 1946. The city was changing, she said. All the factories that had made tanks and planes were making cars again. Dad came back to his family's house on Iroquois Street, near the airport.

"Mom, what did you do while Dad was in the Army?"

"I was eighteen when the war started, just finishing high school," Mom said, measuring out the green beans. "Aunt Mae made sure I went straight to college. I was studying to become a teacher while your daddy was overseas."

"Your daddy wanted to be a photographer." Mom drained the green beans into the colander. "He went to the Detroit School of Photography, then to Slade-Gragg Academy. The G.I. Bill paid for his schooling."

"What's the G.I. Bill?"

"A promise the government made to soldiers who came back from the war. It helped pay for school and houses, though..." She paused. "It didn't always work the same for everyone."

"Did Dad always take pictures?"

"Oh yes. He started his own business - Gad-A-Bout Photography. But taking pictures can't support a family, so your daddy got a job with the government, working with numbers at the IRS, then later at TACOM".

I thought about Dad in his darkroom, carefully developing pictures in the red light. Mom was not part of that.  Neither was I.  Photography was Dad’s safe place.  With his camera he would be present and invisible, like … a ghost.

Mom's Story

While the food simmered, I asked Mom about the pictures I'd seen of her as a little girl.

"Mom, were you always smart?"

She laughed, the sound light and musical.

"Classie insisted that Vivian and I get an education. I loved school from the very beginning. Made straight A's all through college."

"Why do you still go to school?"

Mom wiped her hands on her apron and turned to face me fully.

I'd watched Mom in her classroom after school sometimes, working with her student teachers from Wayne State. She'd click across the linoleum floor in her heels that lifted her 4'11" body to just over 5'0", watching them teach, taking notes in her precise handwriting. Some of those college students looked scared of her.

"Are you strict with the student teachers like you are with me in Primary Church?"

Mom smiled at that.

"If you're going to teach children, you need to know what you're doing."

How They Met

"Mom, how did you and Dad meet?"

Her face softened as she stirred the pork and beans.

"Aunt Mae's neighbor, Mrs. Julia Clingman, introduced us. Mrs. Clingman and her husband Albert had moved away, and their house, just to the north of Aunt Mae's, stood vacant." Mom chuckled. "She was right."

"What was Dad like when you first met him?"

"Handsome. Always dressed so nice, always on time. Very polite." She glanced toward the basement stairs. "He was different from the other men I knew. Quieter. More thoughtful. I tried to imagine them young, meeting for the first time. Mom with her straight A's and Dad with his camera.

"Why did you marry him?"

Mom turned the heat down under the skillet and looked at me with that expression she got when she was thinking of exactly the right words.

"I loved your Daddy."

Understanding

Later, after Dad came upstairs for dinner and we sat around the table, I watched them differently. Dad, methodical and gentle, preparing his usual green salad with iceberg lettuce, cucumber and tomato slices - content in his quiet rituals. Mom, animated as she directed:

"Howard, you can get the plates down." "Derrick, you can get the silverware and the napkins."

It was not until adulthood that I recognized the oddity of the phrase "you can," the request that was a command shrouded in an observation.

And as I walked through the dining room to the only full bathroom in the house, I looked at all the pictures in the frames. Mom. Dad. Aunt Mae. Me. Aunt Vivian. Sister and Paul. This was my family.

The Awakening

It wasn't until I was ten that it finally hit me like cold water. I was making my usual trip past the photograph when I really looked at those men in the front row - the important-looking ones in chairs. Every single man in those front chairs was white. Every one. All the Black soldiers, including Dad, stood in the back rows. It wasn't random. It wasn't coincidence. It was the rule.

I stared at that photo with new eyes, seeing what had been invisible before. Dad's serious expression suddenly made sense - not just military discipline, but something heavier. The careful distance in his young eyes. The way he stood perfectly straight but somehow separate.

Looking at that photograph with this new understanding, I began to see something about the man who lived upstairs. Dad had learned early how to exist in spaces where he wasn't quite equal, where his service meant something different than the white soldiers' service. Where being excellent wasn't enough to earn a seat in the front row.

That photograph became a bridge between Dad's experience and mine - two generations learning to navigate spaces that included us but didn't quite accept us.

Standing there in our basement, staring at Dad's young face among those careful rows, I finally understood what I'd been searching for in all those childhood stares. Not just my father's history, but a map for my own journey. Need a transitional thought here…At ten I didn’t fully grasp it, but i would learn that We were both men learning to move through a world that demanded constant calculation, both building walls to protect ourselves while searching for places where we truly belonged.

The photograph would hang there for decades more, Dad's serious young face forever frozen among those segregated ranks. But now when I looked at it, I saw more than just a soldier. I saw a teacher, showing me how to stand straight and maintain your dignity, even when the world puts you in the back row.
